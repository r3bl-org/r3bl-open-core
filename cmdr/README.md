We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user interfaces (TUI).
We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and build all kinds of awesome
apps for it.

1. üîÆ Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind of rich TUI
   development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the frontend mobile and web
   development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.

   - Taking inspiration from things like [React](https://react.dev/),
     [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
     [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/),
     [iced-rs](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/), [Jetpack
     Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose),
     [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming),
     [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), but making everything async (so they can
     be run in parallel & concurrent via [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)).
   - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
   - Using proc macros to create DSLs to implement something inspired by
     [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) &
     [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming).

2. üåé We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.

   - The idea here is not to rebuild `tmux` in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a
     single terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or
     "tasks") that run in the same process that renders to one terminal window.
   - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "app" switching,
     routing, tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI
     apps (which are tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the
     same window. So you can imagine that all these "app"s have shared application
     state. Each "app" may also have its own local application state.
   - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we plan to build (for which this
     infrastructure acts as the open source engine):
     1. Multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting.
     2. Integrations w/ github issues.
     3. Integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs.

All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core`
[repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/) provide lots of useful
functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface) apps, along w/ general
niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ü¶Ä can enjoy üéâ.

## Installation

The two apps, `edi` and `giti`, that comprise `r3bl-cmdr` will put a smile on your face and
make you more productive. These apps are currently available as early access preview üê£.

- üò∫ `giti` - an interactive git CLI app designed to give you more confidence and a better
  experience when working with git.
- ü¶ú `edi` - a TUI Markdown editor that lets you edit Markdown files in your terminal in
  style.

To install `r3bl-cmdr` on your system, run the following command, assuming you have
`cargo` on your system:

```bash
cargo install r3bl-cmdr
```

If you don't have `cargo` on your system, you can either:

1. Follow these [instructions](https://rustup.rs/) to install `cargo` on your system
   first. Then run `cargo install r3bl-cmdr` to install this crate.
2. Build the binaries from the crate's source code. First clone this
   [repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/). Then, run `cd
   r3bl-open-core/cmdr && cargo install`.

## Changelog

Please check out the
[changelog](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#r3bl-cmdr) to
