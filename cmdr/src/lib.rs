//!
//! 1. Go to the `cmdr` folder in your terminal.
//! 2. Run `nu run install` to install `giti` locally to `~/.cargo/bin`.
//! 3. Run `giti` from anywhere on your system.
//! 4. To delete one or more branches in your repo run `giti branch delete`.
//! 5. If you want to generate log output for `giti`, run `giti -l`. For example, `giti -l
//!    branch delete`. To view this log output run `nu run log`.

//!
//! ### Prerequisites
//! <a id="markdown-prerequisites" name="prerequisites"></a>
//!
//! ðŸŒ  In order for these to work you have to install the Rust toolchain, `nu`, `cargo-watch`, `bat`,
//! and `flamegraph` on your system. Here are the instructions:
//!
//! 1. Install the Rust toolchain using `rustup` by following the instructions
//!    [here](https://rustup.rs/).
//! 1. Install `cargo-watch` using `cargo install cargo-watch`.
//! 1. Install `flamegraph` using `cargo install flamegraph`.
//! 1. Install `bat` using `cargo install bat`.
//! 1. Install [`nu`](https://crates.io/crates/nu) shell on your system using `cargo install nu`. It is
//!    available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
//!
//! ### Nu shell scripts to build, run, test etc.
