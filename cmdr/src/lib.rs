//!
//! We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user
//! interfaces (TUI). We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and
//! build all kinds of awesome apps for it.
//!
//! 1. üîÆ Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind
//!    of rich TUI development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the
//!    frontend mobile and web development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.
//!
//!   - Taking inspiration from things like [React](https://react.dev/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
//!     [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/), [iced-rs](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/),
//!     [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose), [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming),
//!     [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), but making everything async (so they can be
//!     run in parallel & concurrent via [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)).
//!   - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
//!   - Using macros to create DSLs to implement something inspired by [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css)
//!     & [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming).
//!
//! 2. üåé We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.
//!
//!   - The idea here is not to rebuild `tmux` in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a
//!     single terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or
//!     "tasks") that run in the same process that renders to one terminal window.
//!   - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "applet" switching,
//!     routing, tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI
//!     apps (which are tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the
//!     same window. So you can imagine that all these "applets" have shared application
//!     state. Each "applet" may also have its own local application state.
//!   - You can mix and match "Full TUI" with "Partial TUI" to build for whatever use case
//!     you need. `r3bl_tui` allows you to create application state that can be moved
//!     between various "applets", where each "applet" can be "Full TUI" or "Partial TUI".
//!   - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we plan to build (for which this
//!     infrastructure acts as the open source engine):
//!     1. Multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting.
//!     2. Integrations w/ github issues.
//!     3. Integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs.
//!
//! All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core` [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)
//! provide lots of useful functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface) apps,
//! along w/ general niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ü¶Ä can enjoy üéâ.
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! The two apps, `edi` and `giti`, that comprise `r3bl-cmdr` will make you smile and make
//! you more productive. These apps are currently available as early access preview üê£.
//!
//! - üò∫ `giti` - an interactive git CLI app designed to give you more confidence and a
//!   better experience when working with git.
//! - ü¶ú `edi` - a TUI Markdown editor that lets you edit Markdown files in your terminal
//!   in style.
//!
//! To install `r3bl-cmdr` on your system, run the following command, assuming you have
//! `cargo` on your system:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install r3bl-cmdr
//! ```
//!
//! If you don't have `cargo` on your system, you can either:
//!
//! 1. Follow these [instructions](https://rustup.rs/) to install `cargo` on your system
//!    first. Then run `cargo install r3bl-cmdr` to install this crate.
//! 2. Build the binaries from the crate's source code. First clone this [repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/).
//!    Then, run `cd r3bl-open-core/cmdr && cargo install`.
//!
