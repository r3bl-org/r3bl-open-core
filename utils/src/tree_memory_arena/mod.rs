//! This module contains [`Arena`] a non-binary tree implementation that is
//! thread safe, and [`MTArena`] a variant of the tree that supports parallel
//! tree walking.
//!
//! ðŸ’¡ You can learn more about how this library was built from this
//! [developerlife.com article](https://developerlife.com/2022/02/24/rust-non-binary-tree/).
//!
//! ðŸ“œ There are more complex ways of using [`Arena`] and [`MTArena`]. Please
//! look at these extensive integration tests that put them thru their paces
//! [here](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-rs-utils/blob/main/tests/tree_memory_arena_test.rs).
