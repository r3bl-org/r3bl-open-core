//!
//! We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user interfaces (TUI).
//! We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and build all kinds of awesome
//! apps for it.
//!
//! 1. üîÆ Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind of rich TUI
//!    development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the frontend mobile and web
//!    development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.
//!
//!    - Taking inspiration from things like [React](https://react.dev/),
//!      [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
//!      [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/),
//!      [iced-rs](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/), [Jetpack
//!      Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose),
//!      [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming),
//!      [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), but making everything async (so they can
//!      be run in parallel & concurrent via [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)).
//!    - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
//!    - Using proc macros to create DSLs to implement something inspired by
//!      [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) &
//!      [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming).
//!
//! 2. üåé We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.
//!
//!    - The idea here is not to rebuild `tmux` in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a
//!      single terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or
//!      "tasks") that run in the same process that renders to one terminal window.
//!    - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "app" switching,
//!      routing, tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI
//!      apps (which are tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the
//!      same window. So you can imagine that all these "app"s have shared application
//!      state. Each "app" may also have its own local application state.
//!    - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we plan to build (for which this
//!      infrastructure acts as the open source engine):
//!      1. Multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting.
//!      2. Integrations w/ github issues.
//!      3. Integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs.
//!
//! All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core`
//! [repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/) provide lots of useful
//! functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface) apps, along w/ general
//! niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ü¶Ä can enjoy üéâ.

//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! This library contains some utilities that are useful for building TUI apps in Rust,
//! like memory arena for non-binary trees.
//!
//! There used to be a lot more in this library, but we have since moved them to separate
//! crates in the [`r3bl-open-core`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/) repo.
//!
//! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fun fact: before we built this crate, we built a library that is similar in
//! spirit for TypeScript (for TUI apps on Node.js) called
//! [r3bl-ts-utils](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-ts-utils/). We have long since
//! switched to Rust ü¶Äüéâ.
//!
//! # Changelog
//!
//! Please check out the
//! [changelog](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#r3bl_rs_utils)
//! to see how the library has evolved over time.
