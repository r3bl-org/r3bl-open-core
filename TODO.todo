      - GUI meets TUI, text reliant but GUI feeling apps that run in a terminal,
      - ASCII art is used gfor UI (eg: dialog boxes being drawn w/ ANSI chars)
      - ANSI escape codes are generated for the entire UI and send to stdout
      - Redux store, and app is constructed, then injected into main_event_loop() fn
    ☐ mental model for the entire thing (dependency injection, etc)
