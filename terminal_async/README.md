We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user
interfaces (TUI). We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and
build all kinds of awesome apps for it.

1. ðŸ”® Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind
   of rich TUI development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the
   frontend mobile and web development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.

   - Taking inspiration from things like [React](https://react.dev/),
     [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
     [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/),
     [iced-rs](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/), [Jetpack
     Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose),
     [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming),
     [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), but making everything async (so they can
     be run in parallel & concurrent via [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)).
   - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
   - Using proc macros to create DSLs to implement something inspired by
     [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) &
     [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming).

2. ðŸŒŽ We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.

   - The idea here is not to rebuild `tmux` in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a
     single terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or
     "tasks") that run in the same process that renders to one terminal window.
   - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "app" switching,
     routing, tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI
     apps (which are tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the
     same window. So you can imagine that all these "app"s have shared application
     state. Each "app" may also have its own local application state.
   - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we plan to build (for which this
     infrastructure acts as the open source engine):
     1. Multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting.
     2. Integrations w/ github issues.
     3. Integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs.

All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core`
[repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/) provide lots of useful
functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface) apps, along w/ general
niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ðŸ¦€ can enjoy ðŸŽ‰.

## Introduction

The `r3bl_terminal_async` library lets your CLI program be asynchronous and
interactive without blocking the main thread. Your spawned tasks can use it to
concurrently write to the display output, pause and resume it. You can also display of
colorful animated spinners âŒ›ðŸŒˆ for long running tasks. With it, you can create
beautiful, powerful, and interactive REPLs (read execute print loops) with ease.

1. Because
   [`read_line()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line)
   is blocking. And there is no way to terminate an OS thread that is blocking in
   Rust. To do this you have to exit the process (who's thread is blocked in
   `read_line()`).

    - There is no way to get `read_line()` unblocked once it is blocked.
    - You can use
      [`process::exit()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/fn.exit.html) or
      [`panic!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/index.html) to kill the entire
      process. This is not appealing.
    - Even if that task is wrapped in a [`thread::spawn()` or
      `thread::spawn_blocking()`](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/spawning), it isn't
      possible to cancel or abort that thread, without cooperatively asking it to
      exit. To see what this type of code looks like, take a look at
      [this](https://github.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/blob/fcd730c4b17ed0b09ff2c1a7ac4dd5b4a0c66e49/tcp-api-server/src/client_task.rs#L275).

2. Another problem is that when a thread is blocked in `read_line()`, and you have to
   display output to `stdout` concurrently, this poses some challenges.

    - This is because the caret is moved by `read_line()` and it blocks.
    - When another thread / task writes to `stdout` concurrently, it assumes that the
      caret is at row 0 of a new line.
    - This results in output that doesn't look good since it clobbers the
      `read_line()` output, which assumes that no other output will be produced, while
      is blocking for user input, resulting in a bad user experience.

## Features

1. Read user input from the terminal line by line, while your program concurrently
   writes lines to the same terminal. One [`Readline`] instance can be used to spawn
   many async `stdout` writers ([r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter]) that can write to
   the terminal concurrently. For most users the [`TerminalAsync`] struct is the
   simplest way to use this crate. You rarely have to access the underlying
   [`Readline`] or [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] directly. But you can if you
   need to. [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] can be cloned and is thread-safe.
   However, there is only one instance of [`Readline`] per [`TerminalAsync`] instance.

2. Generate a spinner (indeterminate progress indicator). This spinner works
   concurrently with the rest of your program. When the [`Spinner`] is active it
   automatically pauses output from all the [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`]
   instances that are associated with one [`Readline`] instance. Typically a spawned
   task clones its own [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] to generate its output.
   This is useful when you want to show a spinner while waiting for a long-running
   task to complete. Please look at the example to see this in action, by running
   `cargo run --example terminal_async`. Then type `starttask1`, press Enter. Then
   type `spinner`, press Enter.

3. Use tokio tracing with support for concurrent `stout` writes. If you choose to log
   to `stdout` then the concurrent version ([`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`]) from
   this crate will be used. This ensures that the concurrent output is supported even
   for your tracing logs to `stdout`.

4. You can also plug in your own terminal, like `stdout`, or `stderr`, or any other
   terminal that implements [`SendRawTerminal`] trait for more details.

This crate can detect when your terminal is not in interactive mode. Eg: when you pipe
the output of your program to another program. In this case, the `readline` feature is
disabled. Both the [`TerminalAsync`] and [`Spinner`] support this functionality. So if
you run the examples in this crate, and pipe something into them, they won't do
anything.

Here's an example:

```bash
# This will work.
cargo run --examples terminal_async

# This won't do anything. Just exits with no error.
echo "hello" | cargo run --examples terminal_async
```

### Pause and resume support

The pause and resume functionality is implemented using:
- [LineState::is_paused] - Used to check if the line state is paused and affects
  rendering and input.
- [LineState::set_paused] - Use to set the paused state via the
  [r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter] below. This can't be called directly (outside the
  crate itself).
- [r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter::line_state_control_channel_sender] - Mechanism
  used to manipulate the paused state.

The [Readline::new] or [TerminalAsync::try_new] create a `line_channel` to send and
receive [r3bl_rs_utils_core::LineStateControlSignal]:
1. The sender end of this channel is moved to the [r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter].
   So any [r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter] can be used to send
   [r3bl_rs_utils_core::LineStateControlSignal]s to the channel, which will be
   processed in the task started, just for this, in [Readline::new]. This is the
   primary mechanism to switch between pause and resume. Some helper functions are
   provided in [TerminalAsync::pause] and [TerminalAsync::resume], though you can just
   send the signals directly to the channel's sender via the
   [r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter::line_state_control_channel_sender].
2. The receiver end of this [tokio::sync::mpsc::channel] is moved to the task that is
   spawned by [Readline::new]. This is where the actual work is done when signals are
   sent via the sender (described above).

While the [Readline] is suspended, no input is possible, and only <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>
and <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> are allowed to make it through, the rest of the keypresses are
ignored.

See [Readline] module docs for more implementation details on this.

### Input Editing Behavior

While entering text, the user can edit and navigate through the current input line
with the following key bindings:

- Works on all platforms supported by `crossterm`.
- Full Unicode Support (Including Grapheme Clusters).
- Multiline Editing.
- In-memory History.
- Left, Right: Move cursor left/right.
- Up, Down: Scroll through input history.
- Ctrl-W: Erase the input from the cursor to the previous whitespace.
- Ctrl-U: Erase the input before the cursor.
- Ctrl-L: Clear the screen.
- Ctrl-Left / Ctrl-Right: Move to previous/next whitespace.
- Home: Jump to the start of the line.
    - When the "emacs" feature (on by default) is enabled, Ctrl-A has the same effect.
- End: Jump to the end of the line.
    - When the "emacs" feature (on by default) is enabled, Ctrl-E has the same effect.
- Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D: Send an `Eof` event.
- Ctrl-C: Send an `Interrupt` event.
- Extensible design based on `crossterm`'s `event-stream` feature.

## Examples

```bash
cargo run --example terminal_async
cargo run --example spinner
cargo run --example shell_async
```

## How to use this crate

### [`TerminalAsync::try_new()`], which is the main entry point for most use cases

1. To read user input, call [`TerminalAsync::get_readline_event()`].
2. You can call [`TerminalAsync::clone_shared_writer()`] to get a
   [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] instance that you can use to write to `stdout`
   concurrently, using [`std::write!`] or [`std::writeln!`].
3. If you use [`std::writeln!`] then there's no need to [`TerminalAsync::flush()`]
   because the `\n` will flush the buffer. When there's no `\n` in the buffer, or you
   are using [`std::write!`] then you might need to call [`TerminalAsync::flush()`].
4. You can use the [`TerminalAsync::println`] and [`TerminalAsync::println_prefixed`]
   methods to easily write concurrent output to the `stdout`
   ([`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`]).
5. You can also get access to the underlying [`Readline`] via the
   [`Readline::readline`] field. Details on this struct are listed below. For most use
   cases you won't need to do this.

### [`Readline`] overview (please see the docs for this struct for details)

- Structure for reading lines of input from a terminal while lines are output to the
  terminal concurrently. It uses dependency injection, allowing you to supply
  resources that can be used to:
  1. Read input from the user, typically
     [`crossterm::event::EventStream`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/struct.EventStream.html).
  2. Generate output to the raw terminal, typically [`std::io::Stdout`].

- Terminal input is retrieved by calling [`Readline::readline()`], which returns each
  complete line of input once the user presses Enter.

- Each [`Readline`] instance is associated with one or more
  [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] instances. Lines written to an associated
  [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] are output to the raw terminal.

- Call [`Readline::new()`] to create a [`Readline`] instance and associated
  [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`].

- Call [`Readline::readline()`] (most likely in a loop) to receive a line of input
  from the terminal.  The user entering the line can edit their input using the key
  bindings listed under "Input Editing" below.

- After receiving a line from the user, if you wish to add it to the history (so that
  the user can retrieve it while editing a later line), call
  [`Readline::add_history_entry()`].

- Lines written to the associated [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] while
  `readline()` is in progress will be output to the screen above the input line.

- When done, call [`crate::manage_shared_writer_output::flush_internal()`] to ensure
  that all lines written to the [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] are output.

### [`Spinner::try_start()`]

This displays an indeterminate spinner while waiting for a long-running task to
complete. The intention with displaying this spinner is to give the user an indication
that the program is still running and hasn't hung up or become unresponsive. When
other tasks produce output concurrently, this spinner's output will not be clobbered.
Neither will the spinner output clobber the output from other tasks. It suspends the
output from all the [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`] instances that are associated
with one [`Readline`] instance. Both the `terminal_async.rs` and `spinner.rs` examples
shows this (`cargo run --example terminal_async` and `cargo run --example spinner`).

[`Spinner`]s also has cancellation support. Once a spinner is started,
<kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> are directed to the spinner, to cancel it.
Spinners can also be checked for completion or cancellation by long running tasks, to
ensure that they exit as a response to user cancellation. Take a look at the
`examples/terminal_async.rs` file to get an understanding of how to use this API.

The third change is that [`TerminalAsync::try_new()`] now accepts prompts that can
have ANSI escape sequences in them. Here's an example of this.

```rust
    let prompt = {
        let user = "naz";
        let prompt_seg_1 = "â•­".magenta().on_dark_grey().to_string();
        let prompt_seg_2 = format!("â”¤{user}â”œ").magenta().on_dark_grey().to_string();
        let prompt_seg_3 = "â•®".magenta().on_dark_grey().to_string();
        format!("{}{}{} ", prompt_seg_1, prompt_seg_2, prompt_seg_3)
    };
    let maybe_terminal_async = TerminalAsync::try_new(prompt.as_str()).await?;
    let Some(mut terminal_async) = maybe_terminal_async else {
        return Err(miette::miette!("Failed to create terminal").into());
    };
    Ok(())
```

## Why another async readline crate?

This crate & repo is forked from
[rustyline-async](https://github.com/zyansheep/rustyline-async). However it has mostly
been rewritten and re-architected. Here are some changes made to the code:

- Rearchitect the entire crate from the ground up to operate in a totally different
  manner than the original. All the underlying mental models are different, and
  simpler. The main event loop is redone. And a task is used to monitor the line
  channel for communication between multiple [`r3bl_rs_utils_core::SharedWriter`]s and
  the [`Readline`], to properly support pause and resume, and other control functions.
- Drop support for all async runtimes other than `tokio`. Rewrite all the code for
  this.
- Drop crates like `pin-project`, `thingbuf` in favor of `tokio`. Rewrite all the code
  for this.
- Drop `simplelog` and `log` dependencies. Add support for `tokio-tracing`. Rewrite
  all the code for this, and add `tracing_setup.rs`.
- Remove all examples and create new ones to mimic a real world CLI application.
- Add `spinner_impl`, `readline_impl`, and `public_api` modules.
- Add tests.
