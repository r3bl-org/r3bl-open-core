We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user interfaces (TUI). We
want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and build all kinds of awesome apps for
it.

1. ðŸ”® Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind of rich TUI
   development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the frontend mobile and web
   development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.

- Taking inspiration from things like [React](https://react.dev/),
  [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/),
  [iced-rs](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/),
  [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose),
  [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming),
  [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), but making everything async (so they can be run in parallel
  & concurrent via [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)).
- Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
- Using macros to create DSLs to implement something inspired by
  [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) &
  [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming).

2. ðŸŒŽ We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.

- The idea here is not to rebuild `tmux` in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a single terminal
  window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or "tasks") that run in the same
  process that renders to one terminal window.
- Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "applet" switching, routing, tiling
  layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI apps (which are tightly
  integrated) that are running in the same process, in the same window. So you can imagine that all
  these "applets" have shared application state. Each "applet" may also have its own local
  application state.
- You can mix and match "Full TUI" with "Partial TUI" to build for whatever use case you need.
  `r3bl_tui` allows you to create application state that can be moved between various "applets",
  where each "applet" can be "Full TUI" or "Partial TUI".
- Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we plan to build (for which this infrastructure acts
  as the open source engine):
  1. Multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting.
  2. Integrations w/ github issues.
  3. Integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs.

## Welcome to the monorepo and workspace

All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core` [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) provide
lots of useful functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface) apps, along w/ general
niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ðŸ¦€ can enjoy ðŸŽ‰.

Any top-level folder in this repository that contains a `Cargo.toml` file is a Rust project, also
known as a [crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html). These crates
are likely published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/r3bl_tui). Together, they form a
[Rust workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).

Here's the [changelog](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for this
monorepo containing a Rust workspace. The changelog is a great place to start to get familiar with
what has changed recently in each of the crates in this Rust workspace.

## This workspace contains crates for building TUI, CLI, TTY apps

The [`r3bl_tui`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/tui) crate is the main crate
that contains the core functionality for building TUI apps. It allows you to build apps that range
from "full" TUI to "partial" TUI, and everything in the middle.

Here are some videos that you can watch to get a better understanding of TTY programming.

- [Build with Naz: TTY playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLofhE49PEwmw3MKOU1Kn3xbP4FRQR4Mb3)
- [Build with Naz: async readline](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLofhE49PEwmwelPkhfiqdFQ9IXnmGdnSE)

### Full TUI (async, raw mode, full screen) for immersive TUI apps

[`tui`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/tui/src/tui) gives you "raw mode",
"alternate screen" and "full screen" support, while being totally async. An example of this is the
"Full TUI" app `edi` in the [`r3bl-cmdr`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/cmdr)
crate. You can install & run this with the following command:

```sh
cargo install r3bl-cmdr
edi
```

### Partial TUI (async, partial raw mode, async readline) for choice based user interaction

[`choose`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/tui/src/readline_async/choose_api.rs)
allows you to build less interactive apps that ask a user user to make choices from a list of
options and then use a decision tree to perform actions.

An example of this is this "Partial TUI" app `giti` in the
[`r3bl-cmdr`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/cmdr) crate. You can install &
run this with the following command:

```sh
cargo install r3bl-cmdr
giti
```

### Partial TUI (async, partial raw mode, async readline) for async REPL

[`readline_async`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/tui/src/readline_async/readline_async_api.rs)
gives you the ability to easily ask for user input in a line editor. You can customize the prompt,
and other behaviors, like input history.

Using this, you can build your own async shell programs using "async readline & stdout". Use
advanced features like showing indeterminate progress spinners, and even write to stdout in an async
manner, without clobbering the prompt / async readline, or the spinner. When the spinner is active,
it pauses output to stdout, and resumes it when the spinner is stopped.

An example of this is this "Partial TUI" app `giti` in the
[`r3bl-cmdr`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/cmdr) crate. You can install &
run this with the following command:

```sh
cargo install r3bl-cmdr
giti
```

Here are other examples of this:

1. https://github.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/tree/main/tcp-api-server
2. https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/tui/examples

## Power via composition

You can mix and match "Full TUI" with "Partial TUI" to build for whatever use case you need.
`r3bl_tui` allows you to create application state that can be moved between various "applets", where
each "applet" can be "Full TUI" or "Partial TUI".

### Main library crate

There is just one main library crate in this workspace:
[`r3bl_tui`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/tui).

### Main binary crate

There is just one main binary crate that contains user facing apps that are built using the library
crates: [`r3bl-cmdr`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/cmdr). This crate
contains these apps:

- `giti`: Interactive git workflows made easy.
- `edi`: Beautiful Markdown editor with advanced rendering and editing features.

You can install & run this with the following command:

```sh
cargo install r3bl-cmdr
# Interactive git workflows made easy.
giti --version
# Beautiful Markdown editor with advanced rendering and editing features.
edi --version
```

## Project Task Organization

This project uses three root-level Markdown files to organize day-to-day development work:

### Task Management Files

- **[`todo.md`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/todo.md)** - Active tasks and
  immediate priorities that need attention
- **[`done.md`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/done.md)** - Completed tasks
  and achievements, providing a historical record of progress
- **[`claude.md`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/claude.md)** - AI assistant
  interaction logs and collaborative planning sessions

### Workflow Connection

The task organization workflow connects with the documentation in `docs/` as follows:

- **Strategic to Tactical**: Items from `docs/` planning files (strategic goals, feature designs)
  are broken down into actionable tasks and copied into `todo.md`
- **Planning to Execution**: Complex features get documented in `docs/` first, then their
  implementation steps flow into the daily task management system
- **Documentation of Decisions**: AI-assisted development sessions and decision-making processes are
  logged in `claude.md` for future reference

This dual-level approach ensures both strategic planning (in `docs/`) and tactical execution (in
root-level `.md` files) are well-organized and connected.

## Documentation and Planning

The [`docs/`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/docs) folder contains
comprehensive documentation for this project, including:

### Release and Contribution Guides

- [`release-guide.md`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/docs/release-guide.md) -
  Step-by-step guide for releasing new versions
- [`contributing_guides/`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/docs/contributing_guides) -
  Detailed contribution guidelines including:
  - Branch naming conventions (`BRANCH.md`)
  - Commit message standards (`COMMIT_MESSAGE.md`)
  - Issue creation guidelines (`ISSUE.md`)
  - Pull request procedures (`PULL_REQUEST.md`)
  - Code style guide (`STYLE_GUIDE.md`)

### Technical Design Documents

- Parser strategy analysis and design decisions
- Performance optimization guides (`docs/task_tui_perf_optimize.md`)
- Architecture documentation for various components
- Feature-specific planning and design documents

The `docs/` folder serves as the central repository for:

- **Long-term planning**: Strategic goals and feature roadmaps
- **Technical decisions**: Architecture choices and implementation strategies
- **Process documentation**: How we work and contribute to the project
- **Design artifacts**: Detailed analysis of complex features before implementation

## Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

For Linux and macOS users, use the bootstrap script to automatically install all required tools:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core.git
cd r3bl-open-core

# Run the bootstrap script
./bootstrap.sh
```

The [`bootstrap.sh`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/bootstrap.sh) script will:
- Install Rust toolchain (rustup)
- Install Nushell shell
- Install file watchers (inotifywait on Linux, fswatch on macOS)
- Install all required cargo development tools
- Detect your package manager automatically

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual installation or are on Windows:

```sh
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install Nushell
cargo install nu

# Install development tools
nu run.nu install-cargo-tools
```

## Build the workspace and run tests

There's a unified [`nushell`](https://www.nushell.sh/) script that you can use to run the build and release
pipeline for this workspace, and more (local only operations).

To get a list of available commands, you can review the `nushell` script in the root of this repo
[`run.nu`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/run.nu). To see all available commands:

```sh
nu run.nu
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```text
Usage: run <command> [args]

Workspace-wide commands:
    all                  Run all major checks
    build                Build entire workspace

    run-examples [--release] [--no-log]  Run TUI examples
    run-examples-flamegraph-svg  Generate SVG flamegraph
    run-examples-flamegraph-fold Generate perf-folded format
    bench                Run benchmarks

cmdr-specific commands:

    install-cmdr         Install cmdr binaries
    docker-build         Build release in Docker

Other commands:
    log                  Monitor log.txt in cmdr or tui directory
    help                 Show this help
```

### Key Commands

- `nu run.nu all` - Run all major checks (build, test, clippy, docs, audit, format)
- `nu run.nu build` - Build the entire workspace
- `nu run.nu test` - Run all tests across the workspace
- `nu run.nu watch-all-tests` - Watch for file changes and run tests automatically
- `nu run.nu run-examples` - Run TUI examples interactively
- `nu run.nu run-binaries` - Run cmdr binaries (edi, giti, rc) interactively

### Unified Script Architecture

The root-level `run.nu` script consolidates functionality that was previously scattered across multiple workspace-specific scripts. This unified approach provides:

- **Workspace-wide commands** that operate on the entire project
- **TUI-specific commands** for running examples and benchmarks
- **cmdr-specific commands** for binary management
- **Cross-platform file watching** using inotifywait (Linux) or fswatch (macOS)
- **Smart log monitoring** that detects and manages log files from different workspaces

All commands work from the root directory, eliminating the need to navigate between subdirectories.

## Archive

As this repo grows, changes, and matures, pruning is necessary. The
[`r3bl-open-core-archive`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core-archive) is where all the code
and artifacts that are no longer needed are moved to.

This way nothing is "lost" and if you need to use some of the code that was removed, you can find it
there.

Also if you want to make changes to this code and maintain it yourself, please let us know.

1. You can submit PRs and we can also accept them, and publish them to crates.io if that makes
   sense.
2. Or we can even work out and arrangements to move ownership of the code & crate to you if you
   would like to commit to maintaining it.
