# R3BL suite of TUI apps and library focused on developer productivity

We are building a **powerful suite of command line apps in Rust**, featuring text user interfaces
(TUIs) that unlock new levels of productivity within your terminal.

We lean in to the **terminal as a place of productivity** for software engineers and build
interlinked apps that all work with each other to make you more productive.

## Folder structure and code organization

This repo is organized as a monorepo. Many subfolders are Rust crates. There's a `Cargo.toml` file
at the top level which provides a workspace that allows us to build all the crates in this repo at
the same time.
