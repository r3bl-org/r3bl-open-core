## `r3bl-cmdr`
<a id="markdown-r3bl-cmdr" name="r3bl-cmdr"></a>

### Next Release
<a id="markdown-next-release" name="next-release"></a>

- Changed:
  - Use the latest deps:
     - `r3bl_tui` version `0.5.3`.
     - `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.13`.
- Fixed:
  - TBD: markdown parser issues
  - TBD: editor issues

### v0.0.11 (2024-01-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.0.11-2024-01-14" name="v0.0.11-2024-01-14"></a>

- Added:
  - `edi`, `giti`: Add checks to see if binary needs to be upgraded.
    - Search for `UPDATE_IF_NOT_THIS_VERSION` in `r3bl-open-core` repo (in `cmdr` folder),
      and in `r3bl-base` repo. `UPDATE_IF_NOT_THIS_VERSION` is set to `0.0.11` for this
      release.
    - If upgrade is needed, then display a message to the user asking them to run `cargo
    install r3bl-cmdr` again.
  - `giti` add feature: `giti branch checkout`
  - `giti` add feature: `giti branch new`
  - Add `reedline` version `0.28.0` dependency in `Cargo.toml`.

### v0.0.10 (2024-01-02)
<a id="markdown-v0.0.10-2024-01-02" name="v0.0.10-2024-01-02"></a>

- Fixed:
  - Refactor & clean up the analytics client code.

- Updated:
  - Use the latest `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.11`.

### v0.0.9 (2023-12-31)
<a id="markdown-v0.0.9-2023-12-31" name="v0.0.9-2023-12-31"></a>

- Added:
  - Anonymized analytics reporting to prioritize feature development for `edi` and `giti`.

- Changed:
  - Replace the `run` command with `examples` in the `run` nu shell script. To run an
    example you use `nu run examples`. and provide instructions on the `run` script at the
    top level folder of this monorepo. Update `lib.rs` and `README.md` to reflect this
    change. The behavior of the `run` nu shell script is more uniform across all crates in
    this repo.

### v0.0.8 (2023-12-22)
<a id="markdown-v0.0.8-2023-12-22" name="v0.0.8-2023-12-22"></a>

- Changed:
  - Rename `run.nu` to `run` and update `README.md` and `lib.rs` to reflect this change.
    This is a more ergonomic command to use, when using it directly eg: `./run build`
    (macOS, Linux), or `nu run build` (Windows).

- Added:
  - Add binary target `giti`. This is an interactive git client that is tuified. It is a
    productivity tool for git workflows, and is meant as a replacement for directly using
    `git`. This also serves as a real world example of using the `r3bl_tuify` crate.
    - View all the `giti branch` subcommands (e.g. `delete`, `checkout`, `new`, etc.) and
      select one subcommand using the `select_from_list()` when `giti branch` runs.
    - Delete one or more branches using `select_from_list()` when  `giti branch delete`
      command runs.
  - Add binary target `edi`. This is a powerful TUI Markdown editor. You can use it to
    create new MD files, or edit any type of text file. It supports syntax highlighting
    for most file formats (though `.toml` and `.todo` are missing).
  - Add binary target `rc` aka `r3bl-cmdr`.

## `r3bl_tuify`
<a id="markdown-r3bl_tuify" name="r3bl_tuify"></a>

### v0.1.26 (2024-04-15)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.26-2024-04-15" name="v0.1.26-2024-04-15"></a>

- Updated:
  - Make `clip_string_to_width_with_ellipsis` pub so that other crates can use it (eg:
    `r3bl_terminal_async`).
  - Change the names of enums to be more readable.
    - `IsTTYResult::IsTTY` -> `TTYResult::IsInteractive`.
    - `IsTTYResult::IsNotTTY` -> `TTYResult::IsNotInteractive`.
  - Using latest deps for `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.13`, and `r3bl_rs_utils_macro`
    version `0.9.9`.

### v0.1.25 (2024-01-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.25-2024-01-14" name="v0.1.25-2024-01-14"></a>

- Updated:
  - Dependency updated `reedline` version `0.28.0`, `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.12`.
- Added:
  - Add `tuify/src/constants.rs` with color constants.

### v0.1.24 (2023-12-31)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.24-2023-12-31" name="v0.1.24-2023-12-31"></a>

- Changed:
  - Rename `run.nu` to `run`. This simplifies commands to run it, eg: `nu run build`, or
    `./run build`.
  - Replace the `run` command with `examples` in the `run` nu shell script. To run an
    example you use `nu run examples`. and provide instructions on the `run` script at the
    top level folder of this monorepo. Update `lib.rs` and `README.md` to reflect this
    change. The behavior of the `run` nu shell script is more uniform across all crates in
    this repo.

- Added:
  - Add a new top level function `select_from_list_with_multi_line_header()` in
    `public_api.rs` to allow for multi-line headers in the list selection menu. This
    allows ANSI formatted strings to be used in each header line.

- Fixed:
  - In `select_from_list()`, the `max_width_col_count` is now respected to limit the max
    width of the terminal window that is used.

### v0.1.23 (2023-12-22)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.23-2023-12-22" name="v0.1.23-2023-12-22"></a>

- Updated:
  - Update dependency on `r3bl_rs_utils_core` to `0.9.10`.

### v0.1.22 (2023-12-20)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.22-2023-12-20" name="v0.1.22-2023-12-20"></a>

- Updated:
  - Update dependency on `reedline` crate to `0.27.1`.
  - Update dependency on `r3bl_rs_utils_core` to `0.9.9`.

- Removed:
  - Remove dependency on `r3bl_tui` crate.

- Changed:
  - Change the default theme so that it is better looking and more readable on Mac, Linux,
    and Windows. Add many different themes to choose from.

- Added:
  - `Ctrl + c` now behaves just like the `Escape` key. In the past, pressing `Ctrl + c`
    would do nothing the user could not exit the app by pressing this shortcut.
  - More code quality and ability to test the main event loop, by creating a new
    `TestVecKeyPressReader` struct, and abstracting the `read()` (from `stdin`) into a
    `KeyPressReader` trait. This is similar to what is done for `TestStringWriter` (to
    `stdout`).

### v0.1.21 (2023-10-21)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.21-2023-10-21" name="v0.1.21-2023-10-21"></a>

- Updated:
  - Upgrade all deps to their latest versions.

### v0.1.20 (2023-10-21)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.20-2023-10-21" name="v0.1.20-2023-10-21"></a>

- Updated:
  - Bug fix: <https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/170>

### v0.1.19 (2023-10-17)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.19-2023-10-17" name="v0.1.19-2023-10-17"></a>

- Updated:
  - Use the latest `r3bl_rs_utils_core` crate due to
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>, and `ansi_term` not being
    maintained anymore.

### v0.1.18 (2023-10-17)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.18-2023-10-17" name="v0.1.18-2023-10-17"></a>

- Updated:
  - Use the latest `r3bl_rs_utils_core` crate due to
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>, and `ansi_term` not being
    maintained anymore.

### v0.1.17 (2023-10-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.17-2023-10-14" name="v0.1.17-2023-10-14"></a>

- Updated:
  - Dependency on `simplelog` is replaced w/ `r3bl_simple_logger` (which is in the
    `r3bl_rs_utils` repo workspace as `simple_logger`).

## `r3bl_tui`
<a id="markdown-r3bl_tui" name="r3bl_tui"></a>

### v0.5.3 (2024-04-15)
<a id="markdown-v0.5.3-2024-04-15" name="v0.5.3-2024-04-15"></a>

- Updated:
  - Dependency changes inherited from `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.13`, and
    `r3bl_rs_utils_macro` version `0.9.9`.
  - Lots of clippy fixes.

### v0.5.2 (2024-01-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.5.2-2024-01-14" name="v0.5.2-2024-01-14"></a>

- Updated:
  - Dependency updated `reedline` version `0.28.0`, `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.12`.

### v0.5.1 (2024-01-09)
<a id="markdown-v0.5.1-2024-01-09" name="v0.5.1-2024-01-09"></a>

- Added:
  - Simple function `ColorWheel::lolcat_into_string()` that receives a string and
    colorizes it using some defaults. It is similar to the
    `ColorWheel::colorize_into_string()` which it uses under the hood, but it is simpler
    to use.

### v0.5.0 (2023-12-31)
<a id="markdown-v0.5.0-2023-12-31" name="v0.5.0-2023-12-31"></a>

- Changed:
  - Rename `run.nu` to `run` in the `tui` folder. This simplifies commands to run it, eg:
    `nu run build`, or `./run build`.
  - Rename `run.nu` to `run` in the top level folder as well.
  - Replace the `run` command with `examples` in the `run` nu shell script. To run an
    example you use `nu run examples`. and provide instructions on the `run` script at the
    top level folder of this monorepo. Update `lib.rs` and `README.md` to reflect this
    change. The behavior of the `run` nu shell script is more uniform across all crates in
    this repo.
  - In `app.rs`, change `App` trait function `app_handle_signal()` to receive 2 new
    arguments: `component_registry_map`, and `has_focus`. This makes it similar to
    `app_handle_input_event()`.

- Fixed:
  - Editor component now cleans up state correctly after new content loads. This includes
    the undo/redo stack, and the render ops cache (for the content).
  - Fix `tui/examples/demo/ex_pitch` example to correctly move back and forward between
    slides.

- Added:
  - <kbd>Escape</kbd> key now clears the selection.
  - <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> now selects all text.
  - Tests for `EditorComponent` for undo / redo history, text selection, and clipboard service.
  - Add tests to editor component for clipboard service.

### v0.4.0 (2023-12-22)
<a id="markdown-v0.4.0-2023-12-22" name="v0.4.0-2023-12-22"></a>

- Changed:
  - Drop the use of Redux for state management entirely. Replace this with mutable state.
    And a new architecture for App and Component, that is more like Elm, rather than React
    and Redux.
  - Async middleware functions no longer use Redux for propagating state transitions to
    the app; instead, they now achieve this through [async `tokio::mpsc`
    channels](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels). Here's a [design
    doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OMB1rX6cUL_Jxpl-OUWMhJijM7c4FoDrK6qDViVXBWk/edit)
    for this change. Here's the
    [issue](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/196) and
    [PR](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/pull/205) for this change. Here are
    some videos that go over this massive change:
    - <https://youtu.be/o2CVEikbEAQ>
    - <https://youtu.be/Ne5-MXxt97A>
  - In the editor component, disable the syntect highlighter for the editor by default
    and just use the custom MD parser. For files that are not Markdown, we will probably
    need to enable syntect in the future since it is not covered by the custom MD parser &
    highlighter combo.

- Fixed:
  - Fix the custom MD parser so that it correctly parses plain text.

- Added:
  - Add undo, redo support for the editor component.
  - Add binary target for `edi` which is going to be a Markdown editor similar to `nano`
    or `micro`. It is meant to showcase what the `r3bl_tui` crate can do. It is also meant
    to be a useful productivity tool.
  - Add function `colorize_into_string()` to make it easy to apply color wheel to a string
    and then convert it into an ANSI styled string that can be used to print to the
    terminal emulator. Also added conversion function
    `convert_tui_color_into_r3bl_ansi_color()` to convert from `TuiColor` to
    `r3bl_ansi_term::Color`.
  - In editor component, add support for caching rendered output of content. When the
    content changes, or the viewport size or window size change, the cache is invalidated.
    This is useful for performance reasons. It also leverages the undo/redo system for
    cache invalidation (which makes it fast to invalidate the render ops cache w/out
    having to do a content comparison to detect changes).
  - Add lots of editor component tests for selection, content cache.

- Updated:
  - Update dependency on `reedline` crate to `0.27.1`.
  - Update dependency on `r3bl_rs_utils_core` to `0.9.10`.
  - Update dependency on `r3bl_rs_utils_macro` to `0.9.8`.

### v0.3.10 (2023-10-29)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.10-2023-10-29" name="v0.3.10-2023-10-29"></a>

- Changed:
  - Replaced `arboard` crate with `copypasta-ext`.
    - `arboard` was not working well on macOS and Windows.
    - The `copypasta-ext` crate should fix the problem w/ dropping the clipboard contents
      when an app using the editor component exits.
  - Added deps are upgraded to their latest versions.
  - Changed `cargo.deny` so that it now accepts `ISC` license.
- Added:
  - Support for select, copy, cut, paste, and delete have been added to the editor component.

### v0.3.9 (2023-10-29)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.9-2023-10-29" name="v0.3.9-2023-10-29"></a>

- Changed:
  - Dropped support for `clipboard` crate. Used `arboard` instead which is actively
    maintained and supported by 1Password. New Github Actions have been added to ensure
    that `cargo-deny` is used in order to check for crates going unmaintained (along w/
    license audit checks). There are known issues w/ this crate on Wayland & Arch.
    <https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/commit/3ba4ff821373361bedcd0b7185a4b6ba15b745c8>

### v0.3.7 (2023-10-21)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.7-2023-10-21" name="v0.3.7-2023-10-21"></a>

- Changed:
  - Dropped support for `palette` crate. Use `colorgrad` instead. More info here:
    <https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/162>

- Updated:
  - Upgraded all deps to their latest versions.

### v0.3.6 (2023-10-17)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.6-2023-10-17" name="v0.3.6-2023-10-17"></a>

- Changed:
  - Switched to using `r3bl_ansi_color` to detect terminal color capabilities and color
    output and conversions.
  - Apply `#[serial]` on tests that mutate global variables to make those tests un-flaky.
    This was already being done in `r3bl_ansi_color`, just bringing this over to the
    `r3bl_tui` crate with this release.

- Removed:
  - Dependency on `ansi_term` which is no longer maintained
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>.
  - Needless dependencies on crates that are not used.

### v0.3.5 (2023-10-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.5-2023-10-14" name="v0.3.5-2023-10-14"></a>

- Added:
  - Support for selecting text using keyboard.
  - Support for copying text to clipboard using keyboard.
- Fixed:
    - Main event loop was actually doing the wrong thing and blocking on the thread. Even though it
      accepted an input event asynchronously using `AsyncEventStream` (`EventStream` is provided by
      `crossterm` and built using tokio async streams), it was blocking this task (running in
      parallel on a thread) as it was waiting for the input event to be processed by the app. The
      fix allows the main thread to simply spawn a new task (in parallel, on a thread) to process
      the input event. An `mpsc` channel is used in order for the async work done to signal to the
      main thread that it should break out of its infinite loop.

### v0.3.3 (2023-04-20)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.3-2023-04-20" name="v0.3.3-2023-04-20"></a>


- Added:
  - Add `ColorSupport` as a way to detect terminal emulator capabilities at runtime. This uses the
    [`concolor_query`](https://docs.rs/concolor-query/latest/concolor_query/) crate to detect
    terminal emulator capabilities at runtime.
  - At the `RenderOps` level, update `to_crossterm_color()` so that it uses `ColorSupport` to
    determine the best color to use based on terminal emulator capabilities at runtime. It can
    automatically convert from truecolor to ANSI 256 to grayscale. Note that if a color is specified
    as truecolor, then it will automatically be downgraded. If it is specified as ANSI or grayscale
    then it will not be downgraded.
  - Add `ColorWheel` as a way to consolidate all gradient related coloring. Gradients can be
    specified in truecolor, ANSI 256, or grayscale. The `ColorWheel` will automatically use the
    correct colors based on the terminal emulator capabilities at runtime using `ColorSupport`.
  - Add new Markdown parser written using [`nom`](https://crates.io/crates/nom) crate called
    `parse_markdown()`.
    - This parser not only parses regular Markdown but it also supports R3BL extensions for notes
      (metadata: tags, title, authors, date).
    - And it also supports smart lists (ordered and unordered). Smart lists also have support for
      todos (in the form of checked and unchecked items).
  - Add a new syntax highlighting engine for the new Markdown parser, in the `EditorComponent`
    called `try_parse_and_highlight()`.
    - It formats headings using different gradients for each heading levels 1-6. It also has elegant
      fallbacks for ANSI256 and grayscale.
    - It formats metadata (tags, title, authors, date) using different fg and bg colors.
    - Smart lists are formatted using different fg and bg colors. Ordered and unordered lists are
      formatted differently. Checked and unchecked items are formatted differently.
    - For code blocks, the `syntect` crate is used to do syntax highlighting based on the correct
      language of the code block. Since the R3BL theme `r3bl.tmTheme` specifies colors in truecolor,
      they will automatically be downgraded to ANSI256 or grayscale based on terminal emulator
      capabilities at runtime thanks to `to_crossterm_color()`.
  - To make console log debugging nicer, some new traits have been added `ConsoleLogInColor`,
    `PrettyPrintDebug`. These traits work together. If a struct implements `PrettyPrintDebug` then
    it gets the implementation of `ConsoleLogInColor` for free (which gives it the ability to print
    using fg and bg colors to the console).

### v0.3.2 (2023-03-06)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.2-2023-03-06" name="v0.3.2-2023-03-06"></a>


- Fixed:
  - Bug when trying to render an app that's taller than the offscreen buffer / terminal height

### v0.3.1 (2023-03-06)
<a id="markdown-v0.3.1-2023-03-06" name="v0.3.1-2023-03-06"></a>


- Added:
  - First changelog entry.
  - Remove dependency on ansi-parser crate:
    [issue](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/91).
  - Make lolcat code better: [issue](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/76).
    - Add `ColorSupport` as a way to detect terminal emulator capabilities at runtime.
    - Add `ColorWheel` as a way to consolidate all gradient related coloring. Use `ColorSupport` as
      a way to fallback from truecolor, to ANSI 256, to grayscale gracefully based on terminal
      emulator capabilities at runtime.
  - Provide for ANSI 256 color fallback for MacOS terminal app:
    [issue](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/79)
- Removed: <a id="markdown-removed%3A" name="removed%3A"></a>
  - Removed lolcat example from demo.
- Changed:
  - The first demo example (`ex_app_no_layout`) now has support for animation. It automatically
    increments the state every second and the gradient color wheel is updated accordingly.

## `r3bl_rs_utils_core`
<a id="markdown-r3bl_rs_utils_core" name="r3bl_rs_utils_core"></a>

### v0.9.13 (2024-04-15)

  - Lots of cargo clippy fixes.

### v0.9.12 (2024-01-07)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.12-2024-01-07" name="v0.9.12-2024-01-07"></a>

- Added:
  - Add `generate_friendly_random_id()` to generate human readable and friendly IDs.

### v0.9.11 (2024-01-02)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.11-2024-01-02" name="v0.9.11-2024-01-02"></a>

- Added:
  - Add more variants to the `CommonErrorType` enum: `ConfigFolderCountNotBeCreated`,
    `ConfigFolderPathCouldNotBeGenerated`.

### v0.9.10 (2023-12-22)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.10-2023-12-22" name="v0.9.10-2023-12-22"></a>

- Updated:
  - Upgrade all the deps to their latest versions: `serde` version `1.0.190`. Propagate
    this to all the other crates in the `r3bl-open-core` repo, and bump their version
    numbers: e.g. `tuify`, `macro`, `tui`, `cmdr`.

### v0.9.9 (2023-10-21)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.9-2023-10-21" name="v0.9.9-2023-10-21"></a>

- Updated:
  - Upgrade all deps to their latest versions.

### v0.9.8 (2023-10-21)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.8-2023-10-21" name="v0.9.8-2023-10-21"></a>

- Updated:
  - Upgrade all deps to their latest versions.

### v0.9.7 (2023-10-17)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.7-2023-10-17" name="v0.9.7-2023-10-17"></a>

- Updated:
  - Dependency on `simple_logger` updated due to this security advisory
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>. `simple_logger` itself had to
    drop `ansi_term`.

### v0.9.6 (2023-10-17)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.6-2023-10-17" name="v0.9.6-2023-10-17"></a>

- Removed:
  - Dependency on `ansi_term` is dropped due to this security advisory
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>. Flagged when running CI/CD
    job on Ockam [repo](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

- Updated:
  - Documentation for `r3bl_simple_logger` crate. And how to think about it vs. using log
    facilities from the `r3bl_rs_utils_core` crate. Update docs there too.

### v0.9.5 (2023-10-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.5-2023-10-14" name="v0.9.5-2023-10-14"></a>

- Updated:
  - Dependency on `simplelog` is replaced w/ `r3bl_simple_logger` (which is in the
    `r3bl_rs_utils` repo workspace as `simple_logger`).
  - `TuiColor` has a few new variants. They can be `RgbValue`, `AnsiValue`, or `ANSIBasicColor`. It
    is safe to use just `RgbValue` since the library will degrade gracefully to ANSI 256 or
    grayscale based on terminal emulator capabilities at runtime (provided by `to_crossterm_color()`
    and `ColorSupport`). If a color is specified as `AnsiValue` or `ANSIBasicColor` then it will not
    be downgraded.

### v0.9.1 (2023-03-06)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.1-2023-03-06" name="v0.9.1-2023-03-06"></a>

- Added:
  - First changelog entry.
  - Move lolcat into `tui_core` crate.
- Removed:
  - ANSI escape sequences are no longer used internally in any intermediate format used by the TUI
    engine. It is reserved exclusively for output to stdout using (for now) crossterm. This opens
    the door for future support for GUI app (not just terminal emulators).

## `r3bl_analytics_schema`

- Updated:
  - Update `r3bl_rs_utils_core` crate due to
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>, and `ansi_term` not being
    maintained anymore.

### v0.9.5 (2023-10-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.9.5-2023-10-14" name="v0.9.5-2023-10-14"></a>

- Updated:

<a id="markdown-v0.3.0-2024-04-15" name="v0.3.0-2024-04-15"></a>

This is the first release of this crate.

- Added:
  - A new crate in this repo that allows for async terminal input and output. This is
    useful for building TUIs that are async and can handle input and output in parallel.
    To build apps that are not full TUI, this is a great option to create interactive CLIs
    and REPLs that are fully async and multithreaded (with input and output) with a really
    powerful (multi) line editor and prompt.

## `r3bl_ansi_color`
<a id="markdown-r3bl_ansi_color" name="r3bl_ansi_color"></a>

- Added:
  - Support for `Grayscale` color output. This is in preparation of making the color
    support work across all platforms (MacOS, Linux, Windows). And use this in the
    `r3bl_tui` crate. Update tests to reflect this.

- Removed:
  - Dependency on `once-cell` removed by replacing `Arc<Mutex<_>>` with `unsafe` and
    `AtomicI8`.

### v0.6.7 (2023-09-12)

    `r3bl_ansi_color`.

- Added:
  - Documentation for `r3bl_simple_logger` crate. And how to think about it vs. using log
    facilities from the `r3bl_rs_utils_core` crate. Update docs there too.

### v0.1.0 (2023-10-14)
<a id="markdown-v0.1.0-2023-10-14" name="v0.1.0-2023-10-14"></a>

- Added:
  - First changelog entry. This crate is a fork of the
    [`simplelog`](https://crates.io/crates/simplelog) repo w/ conditional compilation
    (feature flags) removed. This crate was causing transitive dependency issues in
    upstream repos that added `r3bl_tuify` as a dependency. Here's a link to the related
    [issue](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/issues/160).

- Updated:
  - Dependency on `r3bl_rs_utils_core` & `r3bl_rs_utils_macro` crates due to
    <https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0139.html>, and `ansi_term` not being
    maintained anymore.

### v0.2.4 (2023-10-14)

- Updated:
  - Add single dependency on `r3bl_rs_utils_core` version `0.9.10`.

- Removed:

  - All the source code from the top level folder of the `r3bl-open-core` repo into the
    `utils` sub folder. The crate `r3bl_rs_utils` used to reside at the top level folder
    of this repo. It has been moved into the `utils` sub folder. At the top level, only a
    workspace remains to link all the contained crates together for efficient builds.

### v0.9.14 (2023-10-29)
