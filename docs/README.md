## draw.io

1. Create a new diagram

   - Create a new diagram using draw.io
   - When you save it, make sure to use File -> Export as -> SVG... Make sure to use these settings:
     - ✅ Transparent Background
     - ✅ Dark
     - ✅ Shadow
     - ✅ Include a copy of my diagram
     - Then Export
   - Our convention is to use ".drawio.svg" as the file extension.

2. Update an existing diagram

   - Open the existing diagram (with .drawio.svg extension) in draw.io
   - Make your changes
   - Follow the same File -> Export as -> SVG... as shown above when it is time to save the file

3. Viewing diagrams

   - By following the above steps, the SVG file is really optimized to be viewed w/ a dark
     background (viewing on github.com or on developerlife.com). And if you try to view it w/ a
     light background, it either won't look good or will be illegible.
     - It is easiest to view the diagram on github.com.
     - You can open the SVG file in a browser, then go to developer options, and apply a CSS
       property of background color of black.

## figma.com

New diagrams are best created in Figma and then exported to SVG. Draw.io is difficult to use.

## Videos

You can use the [GPU screen recorder](https://github.com/flathub/com.dec05eba.gpu_screen_recorder)
app for Linux to capture a video of the focused window. You can use the default settings and save
the video as MP4 for upload into github.com & reddit.com.

- Github.com
  - Edit an the main [README.md](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils#readme) file and drag and
    drop the MP4 file from your desktop to the editor. This will upload the video to github.com and
    generate a URL like this: TK:
- Reddit.com
  - TK: only upload a video & add description in a comment below it
  - TK: don't include "xbox" in any substring (eg: flexbox)
