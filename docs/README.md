## draw.io

1. Create a new diagram

   - Create a new diagram using draw.io
   - When you save it, make sure to use File -> Export as -> SVG... Make sure to use these settings:
     - ✅ Transparent Background
     - ✅ Dark
     - ✅ Shadow
     - ✅ Include a copy of my diagram
     - Then Export
   - Our convention is to use ".drawio.svg" as the file extension.

2. Update an existing diagram

   - Open the existing diagram (with .drawio.svg extension) in draw.io
   - Make your changes
   - Follow the same File -> Export as -> SVG... as shown above when it is time to save the file

3. Viewing diagrams

   - By following the above steps, the SVG file is really optimized to be viewed w/ a dark
     background (viewing on github.com or on developerlife.com). And if you try to view it w/ a
     light background, it either won't look good or will be illegible.
     - It is easiest to view the diagram on github.com.
     - You can open the SVG file in a browser, then go to developer options, and apply a CSS
       property of background color of black.
