# TokioConf 2026 Session Proposal

**Breaking the Blocking Assumption: Building Terminal Primitives with Pure Tokio**

---

## Executive Summary

This talk challenges the foundational assumption that terminal applications must use POSIX `readline()` or Windows `ReadConsole()`. After leaving Google in 2021, I built three completely different async primitives from scratch using pure Tokio, shipping them in 3 production applications (a Markdown editor, git client, and command runner) now published on crates.io.

This is not an optimization story—it's a **paradigm shift** that enables fundamentally different architectural possibilities. The immediate mode reactive UI built on these primitives eliminates entire categories of bugs and works seamlessly over SSH without special cases.

### Session Description (for conference attendees)

```
Everyone assumes you *have* to use POSIX readline() or Windows ReadConsole()
for terminal applications. But what if that's a false assumption?

After leaving Google in 2021, I challenged this belief and built three
completely different primitives from scratch using pure Tokio.

This talk shares the architectural blueprint for breaking free from blocking
terminal I/O—and why this paradigm shift enables fundamentally different
application designs.

Learn the three core async primitives powering 3 production applications
(a Markdown editor, git client, and command runner), now published on
crates.io and optimized for SSH:

• Why the "blocking readline" assumption limits all traditional TUI architectures
• Three built-from-scratch async primitives: Async Readline, Choose API, Full TUI
• The immediate mode reactive UI architecture that eliminates blocking
• Real production debugging stories: buffer timing, cross-platform challenges
• Testing strategies for async terminal applications
• Honest takes on what works beautifully and what's still painful with Tokio
```

CORE THESIS: Challenging the "blocking readline assumption" that underpins
all traditional TUI architectures.

This talk demonstrates three built-from-scratch async primitives completely
replacing POSIX readline in production applications:

1. **Async Readline** (async-interruptible-non-blocking)
   - Completely replaces POSIX readline() single-threaded blocking model
   - Enables true event-driven architectures for terminal input

2. **Choose API** (single-shot user interactions)
   - Raw mode without screen takeover or terminal buffer disruption
   - Composable building block for choice-based UIs

3. **Full TUI** (complete raw mode with async event loop)
   - Alternate screen support, fully async, non-destructive
   - Powers immersive applications (edi, giti, rc)

**Production Evidence:**
• Published on crates.io: r3bl_tui v0.7.6 (TUI library), r3bl-cmdr v0.0.24
• Completely open source: github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core
• 12 runnable examples demonstrating primitives in action
• 61 async tests with custom InputDevice/OutputDevice abstractions
• Shipped in developer productivity tools (used by thousands)
• Optimized for SSH (diff-based painting eliminates flickering)

This is not theoretical—it's proven by 3 years of production shipping. The paradigm
shift is: async primitives enable immediate mode reactive UI which eliminates
categories of bugs that plague traditional readline-based applications.

## Detailed Session Outline

### Segment 1: The Blocking Assumption (2 min)
**"Everyone assumes you need readline(). What if that's wrong?"**

The hidden assumption baked into all traditional TUI architecture:
- POSIX `readline()` on Linux/macOS (single-threaded, blocking)
- Windows `ReadConsole()` (blocking)
- These are kernel syscalls you can't truly async-ify
- This blocks event handling, rendering, async middleware, responsive UIs
- **It shapes everything:** architecture, testing, performance, what's possible

**The revelation:** This isn't a limitation to work around—it's a **false premise to challenge**.

---

### Segment 2: Breaking the Assumption (2 min)
**"What becomes possible without the blocking readline constraint?"**

When you build terminal primitives from scratch with pure Tokio:
- ✅ No more main thread blocking
- ✅ Event-driven architecture becomes natural
- ✅ Composable async primitives stack cleanly
- ✅ Immediate mode reactive UI becomes possible
- ✅ Everything works the same over SSH (no special cases)

**This isn't optimization—it's a paradigm shift.**

---

### Segment 3: The Three Primitives (10 min)
**"Three built-from-scratch async terminal primitives"**

#### **Primitive 1: Async Readline** (completely replaces POSIX readline)

**The Problem:** POSIX readline blocks the entire main thread while waiting for user input. You can't handle other events, render UI updates, or run async middleware.

**The Solution:** Non-blocking, interruptible terminal input built on pure Tokio.

**Key Features:**
- Fully async: can handle other events while waiting for input
- Interruptible: can be cancelled and resumed
- SharedWriter ensures safe coordinated output from multiple async tasks
- Example: `choose_async` API for interactive selection

**Where it's used:**
- `giti` git client (branch checkout, deletion, creation)
- `ch` Claude Code helper (interactive choices)

**Code reference:** `tui/src/readline_async/readline_async_api.rs`

```rust
// Your app remains responsive while waiting for input
tokio::select! {
    user_input = readline_async() => { /* handle input */ }
    status_update = background_task() => { /* handle update */ }
}
```

---

#### **Primitive 2: Choose API** (single-shot user interactions)

**The Problem:** Terminal applications often need to ask users to make choices, but doing this interactively usually requires taking over the entire screen (like `fzf`), destroying the terminal buffer.

**The Solution:** Raw mode interaction without screen takeover—perfect for CLI apps that need interactivity without full TUI.

**Key Features:**
- Enters raw mode temporarily for user interaction
- Restores terminal state when done
- Doesn't destroy terminal back buffer
- Composable building block
- Single responsibility: "let user choose one or more items"

**Where it's used:**
- `ch` command (Claude Code helper)
- Any CLI that needs interactive selection

**Code reference:** `tui/src/readline_async/choose_api.rs`

---

#### **Primitive 3: Full TUI** (complete raw mode with async event loop)

**The Problem:** Traditional TUI apps either use blocking I/O (slow, limits concurrency) or resort to complex state machines to avoid blocking (error-prone, hard to test).

**The Solution:** Complete raw mode with a pure async event loop. Every state change triggers fresh render—immediate mode reactive UI.

**Key Features:**
- Alternate screen support (full immersive experience)
- Fully async event loop: no blocking anywhere
- Clean separation: render pipeline ≠ state mutation
- Immediate mode: every state change triggers fresh render
- No frame-skipping, no state sync bugs
- Smooth 60fps animations, zero flickering over SSH

**Where it's used:**
- `edi` (beautiful Markdown editor with syntax highlighting)
- `giti` (interactive git workflows)
- `rc` (command runner with interactive features)

**Code reference:** `tui/src/tui/terminal_window/main_event_loop.rs:282-334`

```rust
// Main event loop: pure async, zero blocking
async fn run_main_event_loop<S, AS>(...) {
    loop {
        tokio::select! {
            // Handle app signals (state changes, middleware)
            maybe_signal = event_loop_state.main_thread_channel.recv() => {
                handle_main_thread_signal(signal, ...)?
            }

            // Handle input events (non-blocking!)
            maybe_input = input_device.next_input_event() => {
                handle_input_event(input_event, ...)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Segment 4: Why This Matters (5 min)
**"The architectural implications of breaking the blocking assumption"**

#### **What This Enables:**

1. **True Event-Driven UI**
   - Don't just work around blocking, eliminate it
   - Input, signals, and rendering all flow through async channels
   - No blocked main thread ever

2. **Immediate Mode Rendering**
   - Every state change triggers fresh render from scratch
   - No stale state bugs (state and UI always in sync)
   - No frame drops or skipping
   - Natural 60fps animation support

3. **SSH-Friendly Architecture**
   - Diff-based painting works naturally (no special hack)
   - Double-buffered rendering eliminates flickering
   - Scales to slow connections without special cases

4. **Composable Primitives**
   - Start with async readline for simple CLIs
   - Add Choose API for interactive selection
   - Go full immersive TUI for complex apps
   - All primitives work together seamlessly

5. **Testable**
   - InputDevice/OutputDevice abstractions
   - Mock stdin/stdout for deterministic tests
   - 61 async tests with custom TTY fixtures
   - No need for real terminal in CI/CD

---

#### **Real Production Stories (3 years of shipping):**

**Story 1: Buffer Flushing Timing**
- Problem: ANSI escape sequences sometimes arrived out of order or incomplete
- Root cause: Buffer flushing at the wrong moments in the async pipeline
- Solution: Explicit flush points and coordinated OutputDevice flushing
- Lesson: Async pipelines need explicit synchronization points

**Story 2: Cross-Platform Terminal Capability Detection**
- Problem: macOS Terminal.app lacks truecolor support, breaking color gradients
- Solution: Automatic capability detection with graceful degradation (truecolor → ANSI256 → grayscale)
- Implementation: Terminal feature detection at startup, applies throughout app
- Lesson: Abstractions matter—InputDevice/OutputDevice handle platform differences

**Story 3: SSH Optimization**
- Problem: Over SSH, every character rendered causes network traffic and latency
- Solution: Diff-based painting (only send changed regions)
- Result: 10x reduction in bytes over SSH, smooth animations even on 28.8k connections (yes, tested)
- Lesson: Good architecture enables optimizations naturally

**Story 4: Testing Async Terminal Applications**
- Problem: How do you test terminal apps that need async input/output?
- Solution: InputDevice/OutputDevice abstractions with mock implementations
- Implementation: Async-compatible mocks that simulate user input and capture output
- Result: Fast, deterministic, CI-friendly tests

---

#### **What Works Beautifully:**

- `tokio::select!` for clean event handling without blocking
- Channel-based architecture for loose coupling and testability
- Immediate mode rendering eliminates state sync bugs entirely
- Async-all-the-way philosophy simplifies reasoning about concurrency
- Primitive composition beats trying to build one monolithic framework

---

#### **What's Still Painful:**

- Terminal capability detection across platforms (no standard interface)
- Signal handling in async context (SIGWINCH, SIGINT need careful coordination)
- Testing terminal interactions without real TTY (still need some integration tests)
- Debugging ANSI escape sequence issues (hard to see what's actually sent)
- Cross-platform differences in terminal behavior

---

### Segment 5: Practical Takeaways (2-3 min)

**Key Principles:**

1. **Question Your Assumptions**
   - What "unchangeable" foundations are actually false premises?
   - What becomes possible if you rebuild from scratch?

2. **Composition Beats Generalization**
   - Three focused primitives > one complicated everything-to-everyone framework
   - Each primitive has one job, does it extremely well
   - Stack them for more complex use cases

3. **When to Use `spawn_blocking`**
   - For actual blocking I/O (PTY reads/writes, terminal syscalls)
   - Don't overuse it—it's for truly unavoidable blocking
   - Wrap carefully to maintain async guarantees

4. **Channel Architecture**
   - Separate input/output/signal channels enable clean composition
   - Channel abstractions (InputDevice/OutputDevice) hide platform differences
   - Makes code testable and mockable

## Speaker Notes & Talking Points

### Opening Hook (Provocative)

"Raise your hand if you've heard: 'You need readline for terminal apps.' Everyone nods. It's baked into every TUI framework. But what if that's wrong? What if it's actually a *false assumption* that limits everything we can build?"

**Pause. Let it sink in.**

"In 2021, I challenged that assumption and asked: what if I built terminal primitives from scratch using pure Tokio? Not as an optimization—but as a complete rethinking of the foundation. Three primitives. All async. No blocking. This changed everything."

---

### The Paradigm Shift Moment

"The key insight isn't: 'We made async input handling.' That's a feature. The insight is: 'We can completely replace the blocking assumption.' That's architecture. That fundamentally changes what's possible."

"With blocking readline, you're stuck in a box. You can't build immediate mode UI. You can't have smooth animations. You can't truly handle events while the user is typing. You're always fighting the blocking assumption."

"Without it? Everything becomes natural."

---

### When Discussing Each Primitive

**Async Readline:**
"This isn't just 'async readline()'. It's 'what if we removed the blocking syscall entirely and built from scratch?' The result works fundamentally differently. You can stack it with other async operations. You can test it. You can interrupt it."

**Choose API:**
"Don't need a full TUI? Just want interactive selection? This primitive lets you do that without taking over the screen. It's composable—you can build it into larger apps."

**Full TUI:**
"This is where the paradigm shift really shines. Every state change triggers a fresh render. Not 'render the changed parts'—render *everything* from scratch. That sounds expensive, but with immediate mode and double buffering? It's incredibly efficient. And because everything is async, you never block."

---

### Bridge to Production

"This isn't theoretical. These three primitives have been shipping in production for 3 years. They power apps that thousands of developers use. They handle all the edge cases—buffer timing, cross-platform quirks, SSH optimization. Every pattern you'll see today came from real problems we solved."

---

### Memorable Conclusion

"Here's the meta-lesson: It's not really about terminal apps. It's about questioning foundational assumptions in your own code. What 'unchangeable' constraint is actually holding your architecture back?"

"Sometimes the best optimization isn't making the existing system faster. It's rebuilding the foundation. And with Tokio, it's actually possible to do that without losing production robustness."

"The three primitives you've seen today work in production because we were willing to question the assumption that everyone else accepted as inevitable. What's the next inevitable assumption in your code that deserves the same treatment?"

---

### Q&A Prep

**Q: "Isn't this just an optimization?"**
A: No, it's architectural. You literally *cannot* express immediate mode UI with blocking readline. It's not faster—it's a different category of capability.

**Q: "Why Tokio specifically?"**
A: Pure async from the ground up. No half-measures. We're not trying to make POSIX readline async. We're using Tokio's primitives (select!, channels, spawn_blocking) to build from scratch.

**Q: "What about Windows?"**
A: Works seamlessly. Once you abstract the primitives through InputDevice/OutputDevice, the platform implementation becomes just another detail.

**Q: "Isn't this overkill for simple CLI apps?"**
A: Start with async readline. Don't use the full TUI. Pick the primitive that fits your use case. They're composable, not monolithic.

**Q: "How does it compare to ratatui/tui-rs?"**
A: Different philosophy. They work with the blocking assumption and optimize around it. We questioned the assumption itself. For different use cases, different tools make sense.

---

## What Makes This Proposal Compelling

✅ **It's Different** - Most TUI talks use ratatui. You're showing architecture innovation from first principles.

✅ **It's Provocative** - "Breaking the blocking assumption" immediately makes people think. It's not just another optimization.

✅ **It's Practical** - Real debugging stories, production apps, open source code. Not academic theory.

✅ **It Aligns with TokioConf Goals** - They want "real experiences and practical lessons from shipping async Rust code." This delivers exactly that.

✅ **It's Original** - Async readline + Choose API + Full TUI + immediate mode UI = unique combination you won't see elsewhere.

✅ **It's Teachable** - 12 runnable examples, 61 tests, complete open source. Attendees can follow along and experiment.
