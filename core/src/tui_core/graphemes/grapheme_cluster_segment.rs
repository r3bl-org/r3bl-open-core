/// # Grapheme Cluster Segment
///
/// Represents a segment of a grapheme cluster within a [UnicodeString].
///
/// 1. This struct does not allocate anything and is [Copy].
/// 2. The [UnicodeString] owns the memory and this struct is a "view" into parts of it,
///    where each part is a grapheme cluster, and each of them is represented by this
///    struct.
///
/// This struct provides information about a single grapheme cluster, including its byte
/// indices within the original string, its display width, its logical index within the
/// [UnicodeString], its byte size, and its starting display column index.
///
/// ## Fields
///
/// - `start_byte_index`: The starting byte index of the grapheme cluster within the
///   original string.
/// - `end_byte_index`: The ending byte index of the grapheme cluster within the original
///   string.
/// - `unicode_width`: The display width of the grapheme cluster, as calculated by
///   [unicode_width::UnicodeWidthChar].
/// - `logical_index`: The index of this grapheme cluster within the
///   [UnicodeString::vec_segment] vector.
/// - `byte_size`: The number of bytes this grapheme cluster occupies in the original
///   string.
/// - `start_display_col_index`: The display column index at which this grapheme cluster
///   starts in the original string.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// The `GraphemeClusterSegment` struct is used to efficiently represent and manipulate
/// grapheme clusters within a [UnicodeString]. It allows for easy access to the
/// underlying string slice, as well as information about its display width and position.
///
/// # UTF-8 is variable length encoding
///
/// Rust uses `UTF-8` to represent text in [String]. `UTF-8` is a variable width encoding,
/// so each character can take up a different number of bytes, between 1 and 4, and 1 byte
/// is 8 bits; this is why we use [Vec] of [u8] to represent a [String].
///
/// For example, the character `H` takes up 1 byte. `UTF-8` is also backward compatible
/// with `ASCII`, meaning that the first 128 characters (the ASCII characters) are
/// represented using the same single byte as in ASCII. So the character `H` is
/// represented by the same byte value in `UTF-8` as it is in `ASCII`. This is why `UTF-8`
/// is so popular, as it allows for the representation of all the characters in the
/// Unicode standard, while still being able to represent `ASCII` characters in the same
/// way.
///
/// A grapheme cluster is a user-perceived character. Grapheme clusters can take up many
/// more bytes, eg 4 bytes or 2 or 3, etc. Here are some examples:
/// - `üòÉ` takes up 4 bytes.
/// - `üì¶` also takes up 4 bytes.
/// - `üôèüèΩ` takes up 4 bytes, but it is a compound grapheme cluster.
/// - `H` takes up only 1 byte.
///
/// Videos:
///
/// - [Live coding video on Rust String](https://youtu.be/7I11degAElQ?si=xPDIhITDro7Pa_gq)
/// - [UTF-8 encoding video](https://youtu.be/wIVmDPc16wA?si=D9sTt_G7_mBJFLmc)
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// This struct is primarily used internally by the [UnicodeString] struct. However, it
/// can also be used directly to access information about individual grapheme clusters.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use r3bl_core::{UnicodeString, ch, col, width};
/// let unicode_string = UnicodeString::new("üì¶üôèüèΩ");
/// if let Some(segment) = unicode_string.vec_segment.first() {
///     assert_eq!(segment.start_byte_index, ch(0));
///     assert_eq!(segment.end_byte_index, ch(4));
///     assert_eq!(segment.unicode_width, width(2));
///     assert_eq!(segment.logical_index, ch(0));
///     assert_eq!(segment.byte_size, 4);
///     assert_eq!(segment.start_display_col_index, col(0));
/// }
/// ```
