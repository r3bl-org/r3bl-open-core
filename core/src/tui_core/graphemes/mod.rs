//! Rust uses `UTF-8` to represent text in [String]. `UTF-8` is a variable width encoding,
//! so each character can take up a different number of bytes, between 1 and 4, and 1 byte
//! is 8 bits; this is why we use [Vec] of [u8] to represent a [String].
//!
//! For example, the character `H` takes up 1 byte. `UTF-8` is also backward compatible
//! with `ASCII`, meaning that the first 128 characters (the ASCII characters) are
//! represented using the same single byte as in ASCII. So the character `H` is
//! represented by the same byte value in `UTF-8` as it is in `ASCII`. This is why `UTF-8`
//! is so popular, as it allows for the representation of all the characters in the
//! Unicode standard, while still being able to represent `ASCII` characters in the same
//! way.
//!
//! A grapheme cluster is a user-perceived character. Grapheme clusters can take up many
//! more bytes, eg 4 bytes or 2 or 3, etc. Here are some examples:
//! - `üòÉ` takes up 4 bytes.
//! - `üì¶` also takes up 4 bytes.
//! - `üôèüèΩ` takes up 4 bytes, but it is a compound grapheme cluster.
//! - `H` takes up only 1 byte.

//!   clusters](https://medium.com/flutter-community/working-with-unicode-and-grapheme-clusters-in-dart-b054faab5705)
//! - [UTF-8 String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html)
//!
//! There is a discrepancy between how a [String] that contains grapheme clusters is
//! represented in memory and how it is rendered in a terminal. When writing an TUI editor
//! it is necessary to have a caret (cursor position) that the user can move by pressing
//! up, down, left, right, etc. For left, this is assumed to move the caret or cursor one
//! position to the left, regardless of how wide that character may be. Let's unpack that.
//!
//! 1. If we use byte boundaries in the [String] we can move the cursor one byte to the
//!    left.
//! 2. This falls apart when we have a grapheme cluster.
//! 3. A grapheme cluster can take up more than one byte, and they don't fall cleanly into
//!    byte boundaries.
//!
//! To complicate things further, the size that a grapheme cluster takes up is not the
//! same as its byte size in memory. Let's unpack that.
//!
//! | Character | Byte size | Grapheme cluster size | Compound |
//! | --------- | --------- | --------------------- | -------- |
//! | `H`       | 1         | 1                     | No       |
//! | `üòÉ`      | 4         | 2                     | No       |
//! | `üì¶`      | 4         | 2                     | No       |
//! | `üôèüèΩ`      | 4         | 2                     | Yes      |
//!
//! Here are examples of compound grapheme clusters.
//!
//! ```text
//! üèΩ + üôè = üôèüèΩ
//! üèæ‚Äç + üë® + ü§ù‚Äç + üë® +  üèø = üë®üèæ‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüë®üèø
//! ```
//!
//! Let's say you're browsing this source file in VSCode. The `UTF-8` string this Rust
//! source file is rendered by VSCode correctly. But this is not how it looks in a
//! terminal. And the size of the string in memory isn't clear either from looking at the
//! string in VSCode. It isn't apparent that you can't just index into the string at byte
//! boundaries.
//!
//! To further complicate things, the output looks different on different terminals &
//! OSes. The function `test_crossterm_grapheme_cluster_width_calc()` (shown below) uses
//! crossterm commands to try and figure out what the width of a grapheme cluster is. When
//! you run this in an SSH session to a macOS machine from Linux, it will work the same
//! way it would locally on Linux. However, if you run the same program in locally via
//! Terminal.app on macOS it works differently! So there are some serious issues.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use crossterm::{self, *, terminal::*, style::*, cursor::*, event::*};
//! use std::io::*;

//!   Ok(())

//! ```
//!
//! The basic problem arises from the fact that it isn't possible to treat the "logical"
//! index into the string (which isn't byte boundary based) as a "display" (or "physical")
//! index into the rendered output of the string in a terminal.
//!
//! 1. Some parsing is necessary to get "logical" index into the string that is grapheme
//!    cluster based (not byte boundary based).
//!    - This is where
//!      [`unicode-segmentation`](https://crates.io/crates/unicode-segmentation) crate
//!      comes in and allows us to split our string into a vector of grapheme clusters.
//! 2. Some translation is necessary to get from the "logical" index to the physical index
//!    and back again. This is where we can apply one of the following approaches:
//!    - We can use the [`unicode-width`](https://crates.io/crates/unicode-width) crate to
//!      calculate the width of the grapheme cluster. This works on Linux, but doesn't
//!      work very well on macOS & I haven't tested it on Windows. This crate will (on
//!      Linux) reliably tell us what the displayed width of a grapheme cluster is.
//!    - We can take the approach from the [`reedline`](https://crates.io/crates/reedline)
//!      crate's
//!      [`repaint_buffer()`](https://github.com/nazmulidris/reedline/blob/79e7d8da92cd5ae4f8e459f901189d7419c3adfd/src/painting/painter.rs#L129)
//!      where we split the string based on the "logical" index into the vector of
//!      grapheme clusters. And then we print the 1st part of the string, then call
//!      `SavePosition` to save the cursor at this point, then print the 2nd part of the
//!      string, then call `RestorePosition` to restore the cursor to where it "should"
//!      be.
//!
//! Please take a look at [crate::tui_core::graphemes::UnicodeString] for the following
//! items:
//! - Methods in [crate::tui_core::graphemes::access] for more details on how the
//!   conversion between "display" (or `display_col_index`) and "logical" (or
//!   `logical_index`) indices is done.
//! - The choices that were made in the design of the `UnicodeString` struct for
//!   performance to minimize memory latency (for access and allocation). The results
//!   might surprise you, as intuition around performance is often not reliable.
