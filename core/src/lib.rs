//!
//! We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user interfaces (TUI).
//! We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and build all kinds of awesome
//! apps for it.
//!
//! 1. ðŸ”® Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind of rich TUI
//!    development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the frontend mobile and web
//!    development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.
//!
//!    - Taking inspiration from things like [React](https://react.dev/),
//!      [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
//!      [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/),
//!      [iced-rs](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/), [Jetpack
//!      Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose),
//!      [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming),
//!      [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css), but making everything async (so they can
//!      be run in parallel & concurrent via [Tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)).
//!    - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
//!    - Using proc macros to create DSLs to implement something inspired by
//!      [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) &
//!      [JSX](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming).
//!
//! 2. ðŸŒŽ We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.
//!
//!    - The idea here is not to rebuild `tmux` in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a single
//!      terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or "tasks") that run in
//!      the same process that renders to one terminal window.
//!    - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "app" switching, routing,
//!      tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI apps (which are
//!      tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the same window. So you can
//!      imagine that all these "app"s have shared application state (that is in a Redux store).
//!      Each "app" may also have its own Redux store.
//!    - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we want to build:
//!      1. multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting
//!      2. integrations w/ github issues
//!      3. integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs
//!
//! All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core`
//! [repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/) provide lots of useful
//! functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface) apps, along w/ general
//! niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ðŸ¦€ can enjoy ðŸŽ‰.

//!
//! <!-- /TOC -->
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! This crate provides lots of low level functionality like Unicode strings (that support
//! emoji), text styling, and more.
//!
//! It is a dependency of the following crates:
//! 1. [`r3bl_tui`](https://crates.io/crates/r3bl_tui)
//! 1. [`r3bl_tuify`](https://crates.io/crates/ir3bl_tuify)
//! 1. [`r3bl_terminal_async`](https://crates.io/crates/r3bl_terminal_async)
//! 1. [`r3bl_cmdr`](https://crates.io/crates/r3bl_cmdr)
//! 1. [`r3bl_macro`](https://crates.io/crates/r3bl_macro) (procedural macros)
//!
//! Due to the [requirements of proc macros being in a separate
//! crate](https://developerlife.com/2022/03/30/rust-proc-macro/#add-an-internal-or-core-crate),
//! this breakdown of one crate into multiple crates is necessary:
//! 1. Put some code in a separate crate (`r3bl_core`) that is used by other crates.
//! 2. Put the proc macros in a separate crate (`r3bl_macro`). This crate also depends on
//!    the `r3bl_core` crate.
//! 3. Finally, make your crate depend on the other two.
//!
//! All the modules tend to be re-exported, making them available from the "main" or
//! top-level crate; more info on this
//! [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html?highlight=module%20re-export#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use).

//! # Changelog
//!
//! Please check out the
//! [changelog](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#r3bl_core)
//! to see how the library has evolved over time.
