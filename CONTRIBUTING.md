This library crate is in service of the apps being built in the
[r3bl-cmdr](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-cmdr/) crate / project.

While the maintainers might currently prioritize working on features, we are open to ideas and
contributions by people and projects interested in using `r3bl_rs_utils` or `r3bl-cmdr` for other
projects. Please feel free to:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils/issues/new/choose).
2. Chat with us on the [r3bl discord](https://discord.gg/pG4wjDnm) in the dedicated `#r3bl_rs_utils`
   channel.

## Good starting points

### ü¶ú New to terminals?
<a id="markdown-%F0%9F%A6%9C-new-to-terminals%3F" name="%F0%9F%A6%9C-new-to-terminals%3F"></a>


Here's a learning path to help you get started:

1. A really good first step is taking a look at `crossterm` crate - it is small and relatively
   straight forward to understand. This will give you good exposure to the underlying terminal
   stuff. Here's a link to the repo's
   [examples](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm/tree/master/examples).
2. Here's some
   [documentation](https://docs.rs/r3bl_rs_utils/0.7.41/r3bl_rs_utils/tui/crossterm_helpers/index.html)
   w/ lots of background information on terminals, PTY, TTY, etc.

### üêí New to the R3BL codebase?
<a id="markdown-%F0%9F%90%92-new-to-the-r3bl-codebase%3F" name="%F0%9F%90%92-new-to-the-r3bl-codebase%3F"></a>


1. A great starting point is this this [README](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils). Here are
   some important sections:
   - [tui](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils#tui)
   - [redux](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils#redux)
2. Here's a [repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/address-book-with-redux-tui/releases/tag/1.0) that is
   a good one to start working on first. This repo is for a simple address book CLI app that does
   NOT have TUI support. It is a good app to convert to using the TUI library to get a solid handle
   on how to build TUIs. This app was intended to be a pedagogical example to get a handle on this
   stuff.
3. Here are some resources to learn more about the project itself:
   - [r3bl_rs_utils repo README](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_rs_utils/blob/main/README.md).
   - [r3bl-cmdr repo README](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-cmdr/blob/main/README.md).
