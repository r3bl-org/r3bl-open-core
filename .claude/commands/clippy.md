Comment Punctuation Rules for all the changed files (in the current git working tree):
Ensure all comments end with proper punctuation following these patterns:

1. Single-line standalone comments: Add a period at the end
   Example: // This is a single line.

2. Multi-line wrapped comments (one logical sentence): Period ONLY on the last line
   Example: // This is a long line that wraps
            // to the next line.

3. Multiple independent single-line comments: Each gets its own period
   Example: // First independent thought.
            // Second independent thought.

How to identify wrapped vs. independent comments:
- Wrapped: The second line continues the grammatical structure of the first
- Independent: Each line could stand alone as a complete thought
