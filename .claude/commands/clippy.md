Fix trailing periods in comments, check test coverage, errors and warnings in tests, doctests, build docs, clippy

# Fix Clippy Warnings

Fix all the warnings generated by:
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets`
  - `cargo test --doc`
  - `cargo doc --no-deps`

# Fix rustdoc link style

For all the code in the staged & unstaged area of the working tree replace any inline
style links like with the proper rustdoc reference-style links. Here's an example:

```
//! The module [`char_ops`] does XYZ.
//!
//! [`char_ops`]: crate::core::pty_mux::vt_100_ansi_parser::operations::char_ops
```

# Fix markdown table formatting

For all the code in the staged & unstaged area of the working tree if the rustdocs have
markdown tables, make sure that they are properly column aligned using whitespaces

# Fix Comment Punctuation

Comment Punctuation Rules for all the changed files (in the current git working tree):
Ensure all comments end with proper punctuation following these patterns:

1. Single-line standalone comments: Add a period at the end
   Example: // This is a single line.

2. Multi-line wrapped comments (one logical sentence): Period ONLY on the last line
   Example: // This is a long line that wraps
            // to the next line.

3. Multiple independent single-line comments: Each gets its own period
   Example: // First independent thought.
            // Second independent thought.

How to identify wrapped vs. independent comments:
- Wrapped: The second line continues the grammatical structure of the first
- Independent: Each line could stand alone as a complete thought

# Fix file formatting

Finally run `cargo fmt -all` to ensure consistent formatting.

# Documentation and Test Coverage

In all the code that is part of the current git working tree, make sure that there is sufficient
documentation and test code coverage.
- For existing tests, make sure they add value and are not redundant or needless.
- If they are needless, remove them. If there are missing tests, then add them.
