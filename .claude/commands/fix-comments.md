In the file currently open in the IDE:

1. In all the rustdoc comments use reference style links for symbols that are enclosed in
   backticks (where this is possible). When adding reference style links, ensure that all
   the added links are at the bottom of the comment block. Once complete, verify that all
   links are correct by running `cargo doc --no-deps` and checking the generated
   documentation.

2. Make sure that any markdown tables in this file is properly formatted with columns
   aligned using the right amount of whitespaces.
