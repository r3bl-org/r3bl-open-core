## What does it do?
<a id="markdown-what-does-it-do%3F" name="what-does-it-do%3F"></a>

Rust crate to generate formatted ANSI 256 (8-bit) and truecolor (24-bit) color output to stdout. On
macOS, the default Terminal.app does not support truecolor, so ANSI 256 colors are used instead.

> This crate performs its own detection of terminal color capability heuristically. And does not
> use other crates to perform this function.

Here's a screenshot of running the `main` example on various operating systems:

## How to use it?
<a id="markdown-how-to-use-it%3F" name="how-to-use-it%3F"></a>

The main struct that we have to consider is `AnsiStyledText`. It has two fields:

- `text` - the text to print.
- `style` - a list of styles to apply to the text.

Here's an example.

```rust
AnsiStyledText {
    text: "Print a formatted (bold, italic, underline) string w/ ANSI color codes.",
    style: &[
        Style::Bold,
        Style::Italic,
        Style::Underline,
        Style::Foreground(Color::Rgb(50, 50, 50)),
        Style::Background(Color::Rgb(100, 200, 1)),
    ],
}
.println();
```

Please a look at the
[`main` example](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl_ansi_color/blob/main/examples/main.rs) to get a
better idea of how to use this crate.

## Build, run, test tasks
<a id="markdown-build%2C-run%2C-test-tasks" name="build%2C-run%2C-test-tasks"></a>

### Prerequisites
<a id="markdown-prerequisites" name="prerequisites"></a>

ðŸŒ  In order for these to work you have to install the Rust toolchain and `just` and
`cargo-watch`:

1. Install the Rust toolchain using `rustup` by following the instructions
   [here](https://rustup.rs/).
1. Install `cargo-watch` using `cargo install cargo-watch`.
1. Install `flamegraph` using `cargo install flamegraph`.
1. Install [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) `just` on your system using
   `cargo install just`. It is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
   - If you want shell completions for `just` you can follow [these
     instructions](https://github.com/casey/just#shell-completion-scripts).
   - If you install `just` using `cargo install just` or `brew install just` you will
     not get shell completions without doing one extra configuration step. So on Linux
     it is best to use `sudo apt install -y just` if you want them.

### Just commands
<a id="markdown-just-commands" name="just-commands"></a>

> Note to run a just command named `all` on Windows, you have to use the following:
> `just --shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c all`

- Build: `just build`
- Clean: `just clean`
- Run examples: `just run`
- Run examples with release flag: `just run-release`
- Run examples with flamegraph profiling: `just run-flamegraph`
- Run tests: `just test`
- Run clippy: `just clippy`
- Build docs: `just docs`
- Serve docs: `just serve-docs`. This is only useful if you SSH into a remote machine via
  VSCode (where you build and serve the docs) and want to view the docs in a browser on
  your local machine.
- Upgrade deps: `just upgrade-deps`
- Run rustfmt: `just rustfmt`

The following commands will watch for changes in the source folder and re-run:

- Watch run: `just watch-run`
- Watch all test: `just watch-all-tests`
- Watch one test: `just watch-one-test <test_name>`
- Watch clippy: `just watch-clippy`
- Watch macro expansion for one test: `just watch-macro-expansion-one-test <test_name>`

## Why make a new crate for this?
<a id="markdown-why-make-a-new-crate-for-this%3F" name="why-make-a-new-crate-for-this%3F"></a>

- There are a few crates on crates.io that do similar things but they don't amenable
  licenses.
- Other crates simply ignore ANSI 256 colors and only support truecolor, even when they
  claim that they support it.
- And there are other crates which don't correctly report that macOS Terminal.app does not
  support truecolor and only supports ANSI 256 color.
