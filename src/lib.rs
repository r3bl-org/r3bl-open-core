//! We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user interfaces (TUI).
//! We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and build all kinds of awesome
//! apps for it.
//!
//! 1. üîÆ Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind of rich TUI
//!    development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the frontend mobile and web
//!    development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.
//!
//!    - Taking things like React, JSX, CSS, and Redux, but making everything async (they can be run
//!      in parallel & concurrent via Tokio).
//!    - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
//!    - Using proc macros to create DSLs to implement CSS & JSX.
//!
//! 2. üåé We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.
//!
//!    - The idea here is not to rebuild tmux in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a single
//!      terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or "tasks") that run in
//!      the same process that renders to one terminal window.
//!    - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "app" switching, routing,
//!      tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI apps (which are
//!      tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the same window. So you can
//!      imagine that all these "app"s have shared application state (that is in a Redux store).
//!      Each "app" may also have its own Redux store.
//!    - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we want to build:
//!      1. multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting
//!      2. integrations w/ github issues
//!      3. integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs
//!
//! These crates provides lots of useful functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface)
//! apps, along w/ general niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ü¶Ä can enjoy üéâ:
//!
//! 1. Loosely coupled & fully asynchronous [TUI
//!    framework](https://docs.rs/r3bl_tui/latest/r3bl_tui/) to make it possible (and easy) to build
//!    sophisticated TUIs (Text User Interface apps) in Rust that are inspired by React, Redux, CSS
//!    and Flexbox.
//! 2. Thread-safe & fully asynchronous [Redux](https://docs.rs/r3bl_redux/latest/r3bl_redux/)
//!    crate (using Tokio to run subscribers and middleware in separate tasks). The reducer
//!    functions are run sequentially.
//! 3. Lots of [declarative macros](https://docs.rs/r3bl_rs_utils_core/latest/r3bl_rs_utils_core/),
//!    and [procedural macros](https://docs.rs/r3bl_rs_utils_macro/latest/r3bl_rs_utils_macro/)
//!    (both function like and derive) to avoid having to write lots of boilerplate code for many
//!    common (and complex) tasks. And even less noisy `Result` and `Error` types.
//! 4. [Non binary tree data](https://docs.rs/r3bl_rs_utils/latest/r3bl_rs_utils/) structure
//!    inspired by memory arenas, that is thread safe and supports parallel tree walking.
//! 5. Utility functions to improve
//!    [ergonomics](https://docs.rs/r3bl_rs_utils/latest/r3bl_rs_utils/) of commonly used patterns
//!    in Rust programming, ranging from things like colorizing `stdout`, `stderr` output to lazy
//!    value holders.

//! crate is made:

//! 2. <https://developerlife.com/2022/03/12/rust-redux/>

//! [here](https://developerlife.com/category/Rust/).
//!
//! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fun fact: before we built this crate, we built a library that is similar in spirit for
//! TypeScript (for TUI apps on Node.js) called
//! [r3bl-ts-utils](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-ts-utils/). We have since switched to Rust
//! ü¶Äüéâ.
