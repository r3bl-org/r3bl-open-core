//! This crate provides lots of useful functionality to help you build TUI (text user interface)
//! apps, along w/ general niceties & ergonomics that all Rustaceans ü¶Ä can enjoy üéâ:
//!
//! 1. Thread-safe & fully asynchronous [Redux](#2-redux) library (using Tokio to run subscribers
//!    and middleware in separate tasks). The reducer functions are run sequentially.
//! 2. Loosely coupled & fully asynchronous [TUI framework](#6-tui-coming-soon) to make it possible
//!    (and easy) to build sophisticated TUIs (Text User Interface apps) in Rust. This is currently
//!    under [active development](#61-tuicore).
//! 3. Lots of [declarative macros](#31-declarative), and [procedural macros](#32-procedural) (both
//!    function like and derive) to avoid having to write lots of boilerplate code for many common
//!    (and complex) tasks.
//! 4. [Non binary tree data](#4-treememoryarena-non-binary-tree-data-structure) structure inspired
//!    by memory arenas, that is thread safe and supports parallel tree walking.
//! 5. Utility functions to improve [ergonomics](#5-utils) of commonly used patterns in Rust
//!    programming, ranging from things like colorizing `stdout`, `stderr` output, to having less
//!    noisy `Result` and `Error` types.
//!

//!
//! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fun fact: before we built this crate, we built a library that is similar in spirit for
//! TypeScript (for TUI apps on Node.js) called
//! [r3bl-ts-utils](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-ts-utils/). We have since switched to Rust
//! ü¶Äüéâ.
