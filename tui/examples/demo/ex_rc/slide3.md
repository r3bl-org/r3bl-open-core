## 💪 Struggle meet greatness, Apr 2019

In most stories where the heroine is the **"chosen one"**, she doesn’t choose herself. These folks tend
to be seemingly average people who aren’t even aware of who they are, and what power they have. Then
comes a moment in time, a `moment of truth`, where they are faced with the struggle. And this is when
they emerge. And they emerge by letting go of who or what they think they are. And in meeting
struggle head on, they find out what they are made of, and they discover themselves. Without this,
they can’t `unlock their power`, or their potential.

Some of us choose to run away from the experience of this `struggle`. And others embrace it head on.
And others embrace it begrudgingly. As long as it’s embraced, you are going to unlock your
greatness. It doesn’t mean that you are going to achieve some external outcomes that others will
think is awesome. Nope. You are going to win because you will find a little bit more about who you
are, and what you are made of. And this knowledge will give you more awareness of who you are. And
if you think you are worth it, then this is the biggest gift that you can get. It will empower you
to take the next step, which might seem impossible at the time. And then as you keep taking these
steps, you begin to question what is impossible. And everything has changed.

When you encounter a `moment of truth`, and you face struggle, you get to _unlock_ a little bit more of
who you are. And it’s your choice to face the struggle. If you choose a life that is less ordinary
and you want to do great things (whatever that means to you), then you are going to face struggle.
When you’re in this struggle, you can only blame yourself for asking for this. And you ask for it
when you reach for what you need or want. When you become a more concentrated version of yourself,
and you start pushing against what others have pushed on your existence (that is meaningless to
you). In this moment when you push back, you have made a choice. And there’s no going back. Struggle
is there to greet you. And you have to greet it right back with greatness. This is the way it has
always been, and will always be, and there’s no sidestepping this, there are **no shortcuts** around
this.

There will `always` be periods of darkness and light in life. Sometimes it seems the light won’t end,
and it will (so cherish it while it’s there). Other times, it seems that the darkness won’t end, but
it will (so don’t be blinded by the pain). In every life some darkness and light falls, and we will
all have to endure the pain until it ends, and enjoy the bliss knowing that it too will end. This is
constant. All you can choose is who you are in the moments when there is much darkness or much
light. It tends to be much easier to handle moments when there is much light, but it’s really
difficult to handle the moments when there is much darkness — which is the struggle. And sometimes
they come together (some light and some darkness). While the light and dark will come and go
repeatedly until we are gone, there are some things you have to be careful of, when you meet
struggle:

1. 🤝 life is a struggle, choose wisely who want to struggle with (I don’t struggle alone, since I find
   strength in people who empower me)
2. 🤔 pick the battles you want to fight, since you can’t fight them all
3. 🗑️  don’t be afraid to let go, because the fear of letting go is often greater than actually letting
   go.

### 🔥 To fighting the good fight!
