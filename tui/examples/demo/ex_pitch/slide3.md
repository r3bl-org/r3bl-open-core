# Developers don’t have the right tools 🧰

Existing tools are optimized for sharing details
about parts of a "thing", not the entire "thing"

⌨️  Developers live in the `terminal` (on macOS, Windows,
Linux) especially in cloud computing environments over SSH

🖥️  There hasn't been any innovation in the UX of software
written for _headless_ environments (no video card / over SSH)
since the 90s (`vim`)
