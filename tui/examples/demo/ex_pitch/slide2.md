# Context is challenging in a remote world üåê

There isn't a cohesive environment in which developers can
capture context around a problem they are solving ... for
_themselves_, or to communicate to **others** on their team

Tools to capture parts of context today:

1. GitHub issues & PRs, JIRA tickets
2. Temporal conversations on Slack, Discord, Chat
3. Git repos
4. Documents in Notion, Google docs, sheets
