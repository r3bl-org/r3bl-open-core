//! Rust uses `UTF-8` to represent text in [String]. `UTF-8` is a variable width encoding,
//! so each character can take up a different number of bytes, between 1 and 4, and 1 byte
//! is 8 bits; this is why we use [Vec] of [u8] to represent a [String].
//!
//! For example, the character `H` takes up 1 byte. `UTF-8` is also backward compatible
//! with `ASCII`, meaning that the first 128 characters (the ASCII characters) are
//! represented using the same single byte as in ASCII. So the character `H` is
//! represented by the same byte value in `UTF-8` as it is in `ASCII`. This is why `UTF-8`
//! is so popular, as it allows for the representation of all the characters in the
//! Unicode standard, while still being able to represent `ASCII` characters in the same
//! way.
//!
//! A grapheme cluster is a user-perceived character. Grapheme clusters can take up many
//! more bytes, eg 4 bytes or 2 or 3, etc. Here are some examples:
//! - `😃` takes up 4 bytes.
//! - `📦` also takes up 4 bytes.
//! - `🙏🏽` takes up 4 bytes, but it is a compound grapheme cluster.
//! - `H` takes up only 1 byte.

//!
//! There is a discrepancy between how a [String] that contains grapheme clusters is
//! represented in memory and how it is rendered in a terminal. When writing an TUI editor
//! it is necessary to have a caret (cursor position) that the user can move by pressing
//! up, down, left, right, etc. For left, this is assumed to move the caret or cursor one
//! position to the left, regardless of how wide that character may be. Let's unpack that.
//!
//! - If we use byte boundaries in the [String] we can move the cursor one byte to the
//!   left.
//! - This falls apart when we have a grapheme cluster.
//! - A grapheme cluster can take up more than one byte, and they don't fall cleanly into
//!   byte boundaries.
//!
//! To complicate things further, the size that a grapheme cluster takes up is not the
//! same as its byte size in memory. Let's unpack that.
//!
//! | Character | Byte size | Grapheme cluster size | Compound |
//! | --------- | --------- | --------------------- | -------- |
//! | `H`       | 1         | 1                     | No       |
//! | `😃`      | 4         | 2                     | No       |
//! | `📦`      | 4         | 2                     | No       |
//! | `🙏🏽`      | 4         | 2                     | Yes      |
//!
//! Here are examples of compound grapheme clusters.
//!
//! ```text
//! 🏽 + 🙏 = 🙏🏽
//! 🏾‍ + 👨 + 🤝‍ + 👨 +  🏿 = 👨🏾‍🤝‍👨🏿
//! ```
//!
//! Let's say you're browsing this source file in `VSCode`. The `UTF-8` string this Rust
//! source file is rendered by `VSCode` correctly. But this is not how it looks in a
//! terminal. And the size of the string in memory isn't clear either from looking at the
//! string in `VSCode`. It isn't apparent that you can't just index into the string at
//! byte boundaries.
//!
//! To further complicate things, the output looks different on different terminals &
//! OSes. The function `test_crossterm_grapheme_cluster_width_calc()` (shown below) uses
//! crossterm commands to try and figure out what the width of a grapheme cluster is. When
//! you run this in an SSH session to a macOS machine from Linux, it will work the same
//! way it would locally on Linux. However, if you run the same program in locally via
//! Terminal.app on macOS it works differently! So there are some serious issues.
//!

//! use crossterm::{self, *, terminal::*, style::*, cursor::*, event::*};

//!
//!   Ok(())

//! ```
//!
//! The basic problem arises from the fact that it isn't possible to treat the "logical"
//! index into the string (which isn't byte boundary based) as a "display" (or "physical")
//! index into the rendered output of the string in a terminal.
//!
//! - Some parsing is necessary to get "logical" index into the string that is grapheme
//!   cluster based (not byte boundary based).
//!   - This is where [`unicode-segmentation`](https://crates.io/crates/unicode-segmentation)
//!     crate comes in and allows us to split our string into a vector of grapheme
//!     clusters.
//! - Some translation is necessary to get from the "logical" index to the physical index
//!   and back again. This is where we can apply one of the following approaches:
//!   - We can use the [`unicode-width`](https://crates.io/crates/unicode-width) crate to
//!     calculate the width of the grapheme cluster. This works on Linux, but doesn't work
//!     very well on macOS & I haven't tested it on Windows. This crate will (on Linux)
//!     reliably tell us what the displayed width of a grapheme cluster is.
//!   - We can take the approach from the [`reedline`](https://crates.io/crates/reedline) crate's
//!     [`repaint_buffer()`](https://github.com/nazmulidris/reedline/blob/79e7d8da92cd5ae4f8e459f901189d7419c3adfd/src/painting/painter.rs#L129)
//!     where we split the string based on the "logical" index into the vector of grapheme
//!     clusters. And then we print the 1st part of the string, then call `SavePosition`
//!     to save the cursor at this point, then print the 2nd part of the string, then call
//!     `RestorePosition` to restore the cursor to where it "should" be.
//!
//! Please take a look at [`crate::graphemes::GCString`] for the following
//! items:
//! - Methods in [`mod@crate::graphemes::gc_string`] for more details on how the
//!   conversion between "display" (or `display_col_index`), ie, [`crate::ColIndex`] and
//!   "logical" or "segment", ie, [`SegIndex`] is done.
//! - The choices that were made in the design of the [`GCString`] struct for performance
//!   to minimize memory latency (for access and allocation). The results might surprise
//!   you, as intuition around performance is often not reliable.
//!
//! # The Three Types of Indices
//!
//! When working with Unicode text in a terminal-based editor, we need three distinct
//! types of indices to handle text correctly. This is because there's a fundamental
//! mismatch between how text is stored in memory, how it's logically organized, and
//! how it's displayed on screen.
//!
//! ## 1. ByteIndex - Memory Position
//!
//! [`ByteIndex`] represents the raw byte offset in a UTF-8 encoded string. This is
//! crucial for:
//! - String slicing operations (Rust strings must be sliced at valid UTF-8 boundaries)
//! - Memory access and manipulation
//! - Efficient storage and retrieval
//!
//! Example: In the string "H😀!", 'H' starts at byte 0, '😀' starts at byte 1,
//! and '!' starts at byte 5 (since '😀' takes 4 bytes).
//!
//! ## 2. SegIndex - Logical Position (Grapheme Clusters)
//!
//! [`SegIndex`] represents the index of a grapheme cluster (user-perceived character).
//! This is essential for:
//! - Cursor movement (users expect to move by visible characters)
//! - Text editing operations (insert/delete should work on whole characters)
//! - Logical text manipulation
//!
//! Example: In "H😀!", there are 3 segments: seg[0]='H', seg[1]='😀', seg[2]='!'
//!
//! ## 3. ColIndex - Display Position
//!
//! [`ColIndex`] represents the column position on the terminal screen. This is
//! necessary because:
//! - Some characters are wider than others (emojis typically take 2 columns)
//! - Terminal rendering requires knowing exact column positions
//! - Cursor positioning and selection highlighting need visual coordinates
//!
//! Example: In "H😀!", 'H' is at col 0, '😀' spans cols 1-2, '!' is at col 3
//!
//! ## Visual Example
//!
//! ```text
//! String: "H😀!"
//!
//! ByteIndex: 0 1 2 3 4 5
//! Content:  [H][😀----][!]
//!
//! SegIndex:  0    1     2
//! Segments: [H] [😀]  [!]
//!
//! ColIndex:  0  1  2   3
//! Display:  [H][😀--] [!]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Conversion Between Index Types
//!
//! The [`GCString`] struct provides conversion operators to translate between these
//! index types:
//!
//! - `&GCString + ByteIndex → Option<SegIndex>`: Find which segment contains a byte
//! - `&GCString + ColIndex → Option<SegIndex>`: Find which segment is at a display column
//! - `&GCString + SegIndex → Option<ColIndex>`: Find the display column of a segment
//!
//! These conversions can return `None` when indices are out of bounds or fall between
//! characters. For example, a ByteIndex in the middle of a multi-byte character would
//! return `None`.
