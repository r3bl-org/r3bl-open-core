use crate::InputEvent;

/// Trait for reading input events asynchronously.
///
/// Provides a unified interface for different input device backends to deliver
/// terminal input events. This abstraction allows switching between crossterm's
/// event polling and direct async I/O implementations.
///
/// # Implementing backends
///
/// Each backend implementation should:
/// - Filter out unsupported event types (Key Release/Repeat, Paste events)
/// - Convert crossterm events to [`InputEvent`]
/// - Return `None` on error or stream closure
///
/// # Why no `+ Send` bound on the returned future?
///
/// This trait intentionally omits `+ Send` from the future return type because:
/// - All implementations hold `&mut self` across `.await` points with non-`Send` streams
/// - The trait is only used within single-task contexts (not sent between threads)
/// - Backend implementations (Crossterm, DirectToAnsi) cannot satisfy `Send` constraints
///
/// **IMPORTANT**: The futures returned by this trait are **NOT `Send`** and cannot be
/// used across thread boundaries. This limitation comes from the underlying stream types
/// used by crossterm and async I/O backends.
