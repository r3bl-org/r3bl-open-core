# Test Data - Do Not Modify

Files in this directory are **test assets** for syntax highlighting tests. They contain sample
content that the test suite uses to validate highlighting behavior.

**Do not** refactor, reformat, rename, or rewrite any file here. Changes will break the
syntax highlighting tests.

If you need to update an asset, do so intentionally as part of a test change - never as a
side effect of a codebase-wide refactor.
