//! ```text
//! [S1: App/Component] → [S2: Pipeline] → [S3: Compositor] →
//! [S4: Backend Converter] → [S5: Backend Executor] → [S6: Terminal]
//!
//! This type is used throughout all stages
//! ```
//!
//! These 27 shared operations appear in both:
//! - [`crate::RenderOpIR`] - IR layer for components/app (with clipping info)
//! - [`crate::RenderOpOutput`] - Output layer for backend (post-clipping)
//!
//! The enum defines operations like cursor movement, colors, text, and screen control
//! that every stage needs to understand.
