# Test Data - Do Not Modify

Files in this directory (and its subdirectories) are **conformance test fixtures** for the
markdown parser. They include real-world markdown samples at various sizes used for regression
and conformance testing.

**Do not** refactor, reformat, rename, or rewrite any file here. Changes will break the
conformance tests.

If you need to update a fixture, do so intentionally as part of a test change - never as a
side effect of a codebase-wide refactor.
