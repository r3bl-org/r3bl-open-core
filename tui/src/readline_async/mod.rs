//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! The `terminal_async` library lets your CLI program be asynchronous and interactive
//! without blocking the main thread. Your spawned tasks can use it to concurrently write
//! to the display output, pause and resume it. You can also display of colorful animated
//! spinners âŒ›ðŸŒˆ for long running tasks. With it, you can create beautiful, powerful, and
//! interactive REPLs (read execute print loops) with ease.
//!
//! 1. Because
//!    [`read_line()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line)
//!    is blocking. And there is no way to terminate an OS thread that is blocking in
//!    Rust. To do this, you have to `request_shutdown` the process (who's thread is blocked in
//!    `read_line()`).
//!
//!     - There is no way to get `read_line()` unblocked once it is blocked.
//!     - You can use
//!       [`process::request_shutdown()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/fn.exit.html) or
//!       [`panic!()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/index.html) to kill the entire
//!       process. This is not appealing.
//!     - Even if that task is wrapped in a [`thread::spawn()` or
//!       `thread::spawn_blocking()`](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/spawning), it isn't
//!       possible to cancel or abort that thread, without cooperatively asking it to
//!       `request_shutdown`. To see what this type of code looks like, take a look at
//!       [this](https://github.com/nazmulidris/rust-scratch/blob/fcd730c4b17ed0b09ff2c1a7ac4dd5b4a0c66e49/tcp-api-server/src/client_task.rs#L275).
//!
//! 2. Another problem is that when a thread is blocked in `read_line()`, and you have to
//!    display output to `stdout` concurrently, this poses some challenges.
//!
//!     - This is because the caret is moved by `read_line()` and it blocks.
//!     - When another thread / task writes to `stdout` concurrently, it assumes that the
//!       caret is at row 0 of a new line.
//!     - This results in output that doesn't look good since it clobbers the
//!       `read_line()` output, which assumes that no other output will be produced, while
//!       is blocking for user input, resulting in a bad user experience.
//!
//! Here is a video of the `readline_async` and `spinner` examples in this crate, in
//! action:
//!
//! ![`readline_async_video`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/docs/video/r3bl_terminal_async_clip_ffmpeg.gif?raw=true)
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! 1. Read user input from the terminal line by line, while your program concurrently
//!    writes lines to the same terminal.
//!    - One [`Readline`] instance can be used to spawn
//!      many async `stdout` writers, [`crate::SharedWriter`], that can write to the
//!      terminal concurrently.
//!    - For most users the [`ReadlineAsyncContext`] struct is the simplest
//!      way to use this crate. You rarely have to access the underlying [`Readline`] or
//!      [`crate::SharedWriter`] directly. But you can if you need to.
//!    - [`crate::SharedWriter`] can be cloned and is thread-safe. However, there is
//!      only one instance of [`Readline`] per [`ReadlineAsyncContext`] instance.
//!
//! 2. Generate a spinner (indeterminate progress indicator). This spinner works
//!    concurrently with the rest of your program. When the [`Spinner`] is active, it
//!    automatically pauses output from all the [`crate::SharedWriter`] instances that
//!    are associated with one [`Readline`] instance. Typically a spawned task clones its
//!    own [`crate::SharedWriter`] to generate its output. This is useful when you
//!    want to show a spinner while waiting for a long-running task to complete. Please
//!    look at the example to see this in action, by running `cargo run --example
//!    readline_async`. Then type `starttask1`, press Enter. Then type `spinner`, press
//!    Enter.
//!
//! 3. Use tokio tracing with support for concurrently writing to `stout`. If you
//!    choose to log to `stdout` then the concurrent version
//!    [`crate::SharedWriter`] from this crate will be used. This ensures that
//!    the concurrent output is supported even for your tracing logs to `stdout`.
//!
//! 4. You can also plug in your own terminal, like `stdout`, or `stderr`, or any other
//!    terminal that implements [`crate::SendRawTerminal`] trait for more details.
//!
//! This crate can detect when your terminal is not in interactive mode. E.g.: when you pipe
//! the output of your program to another program. In this case, the `readline` feature is
//! disabled. Both the [`ReadlineAsyncContext`] and [`Spinner`] support this functionality. So if
//! you run the examples in this crate, and pipe something into them, they won't do
//! anything.
//!
//! Here's an example:
//!
//! ```bash
//! # This will work.
//! cargo run --examples readline_async
//!
//! # This won't do anything. Just exits with no error.
//! echo "hello" | cargo run --examples readline_async
//! ```
//!
//! ## Pause and resume support
//!
//! The pause and resume functionality is implemented using:
//! - [`LineState::is_paused`] - Used to check if the line state is paused and affects
//!   rendering and input.
//! - [`LineState::set_paused`] - Use to set the paused state via the
//!   [`crate::SharedWriter`] below. This can't be called directly (outside the crate
//!   itself).
//! - [`crate::SharedWriter::line_state_control_channel_sender`] - Mechanism used to
//!   manipulate the paused state.
//!
//! The [`Readline::try_new`] or [`ReadlineAsyncContext::try_new`] create a `line_channel` to send and
//! receive [`crate::LineStateControlSignal`]:
//! 1. The sender end of this channel is moved to the [`crate::SharedWriter`]. So any
//!    [`crate::SharedWriter`] can be used to send [`crate::LineStateControlSignal`]s
//!    to the channel, which will be processed in the task started, just for this, in
//!    [`Readline::try_new`]. This is the primary mechanism to switch between pause and resume.
//!    Some helper functions are provided in [`ReadlineAsyncContext::pause`] and
//!    [`ReadlineAsyncContext::resume`], though you can just send the signals directly to the
//!    channel's sender via the
//!    [`crate::SharedWriter::line_state_control_channel_sender`].
//! 2. The receiver end of this [`tokio::sync::mpsc::channel`] is moved to the task that is
//!    spawned by [`Readline::try_new`]. This is where the actual work is done when signals are
//!    sent via the sender (described above).
//!
//! While the [Readline] is suspended, no input is possible, and only <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>
//! and <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> are allowed to make it through, the rest of the keypresses are
//! ignored.
//!
//! See [Readline] module docs for more implementation details on this.
//!
//! ## Input Editing Behavior
//!
//! While entering text, the user can edit and navigate through the current input line
//! with the following key bindings:
//!
//! - Works on all platforms supported by `crossterm`.
//! - Full Unicode Support (Including Grapheme Clusters).
//! - Multiline Editing.
//! - In-memory History.
//! - Left, Right: Move cursor left/right.
//! - Up, Down: Scroll through input history.
//! - Ctrl+W: Erase the input from the cursor to the previous whitespace.
//! - Ctrl+U: Erase the input before the cursor.
//! - Ctrl+L: Clear the screen.
//! - Ctrl+Left / Ctrl+Right: Move to previous/next whitespace.
//! - Home: Jump to the start of the line.
//!     - When the "emacs" feature (on by default) is enabled, Ctrl+A has the same effect.
//! - End: Jump to the end of the line.
//!     - When the "emacs" feature (on by default) is enabled, Ctrl+E has the same effect.
//! - Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D: Send an `Eof` event.
//! - Ctrl+C: Send an `Interrupt` event.
//! - Extensible design based on `crossterm`'s `event-stream` feature.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See the `tui/examples` directory for comprehensive examples:
//! - `readline_async` - Async readline with concurrent output
//! - `spinner` - Animated progress indicators
//! - `shell_async` - Interactive shell implementation
//! - `choose` - Choice selection UI
//!
//! # How to use this crate
//!
//! ## [`ReadlineAsyncContext::try_new()`], which is the main entry point for most use cases
//!
//! 1. To read user input, call [`ReadlineAsyncContext::read_line()`].
//! 2. You can call [`ReadlineAsyncContext::clone_shared_writer()`] to get a
//!    [`crate::SharedWriter`] instance that you can use to write to `stdout`
//!    concurrently, using [`std::write!`] or [`std::writeln!`].
//! 3. If you use [`std::writeln!`] then there's no need to [`ReadlineAsyncContext::flush()`]
//!    because the `\n` will flush the buffer. When there's no `\n` in the buffer, or you
//!    are using [`std::write!`] then you might need to call [`ReadlineAsyncContext::flush()`].
//! 4. You can use the [`crate::rla_println`!] and [`crate::rla_println_prefixed`!] methods to
//!    easily write concurrent output to the `stdout` ([`crate::SharedWriter`]).
//! 5. You can also get access to the underlying [`Readline`] via the
//!    [`Readline::readline`] field. Details on this struct are listed below. For most use
//!    cases you won't need to do this.
//!
//! ## [`Readline`] overview (please see the docs for this struct for details)
//!
//! - Structure for reading lines of input from a terminal while lines are output to the
//!   terminal concurrently. It uses dependency injection, allowing you to supply
//!   resources that can be used to:
//!   1. Read input from the user, typically
//!      [`crossterm::event::EventStream`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/struct.EventStream.html).
//!   2. Generate output to the raw terminal, typically [`std::io::Stdout`].
//!
//! - Terminal input is retrieved by calling [`Readline::readline()`], which returns each
//!   complete line of input once the user presses Enter.
//!
//! - Each [`Readline`] instance is associated with one or more
//!   [`crate::SharedWriter`] instances. Lines written to an associated
//!   [`crate::SharedWriter`] are output to the raw terminal.
//!
//! - Call [`Readline::try_new()`] to create a [`Readline`] instance and associated
//!   [`crate::SharedWriter`].
//!
//! - Call [`Readline::readline()`] (most likely in a loop) to receive a line of input
//!   from the terminal.  The user entering the line can edit their input using the key
//!   bindings listed under "Input Editing" below.
//!
//! - After receiving a line from the user, if you wish to add it to the history (so that
//!   the user can retrieve it while editing a later line), call
//!   [`Readline::add_history_entry()`].
//!
//! - Lines written to the associated [`crate::SharedWriter`] while `readline()` is in
//!   progress will be output to the screen above the input line.
//!
//! - When done, call [`crate::manage_shared_writer_output::flush_internal()`] to ensure
//!   that all lines written to the [`crate::SharedWriter`] are output.
//!
//! ## [`Spinner::try_start()`]
//!
//! This displays an indeterminate spinner while waiting for a long-running task to
//! complete. The intention with displaying this spinner is to give the user an indication
//! that the program is still running and hasn't hung up or become unresponsive. When
//! other tasks produce output concurrently, this spinner's output will not be clobbered.
//! Neither will the spinner output clobber the output from other tasks. It suspends the
//! output from all the [`crate::SharedWriter`] instances that are associated with one
//! [`Readline`] instance. Both the `readline_async.rs` and `spinner.rs` examples shows
//! this (`cargo run --example readline_async` and `cargo run --example spinner`).
//!
//! [`Spinner`]s also has cancellation support. Once a spinner is started,
//! <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> are directed to the spinner, to cancel it.
//! Spinners can also be checked for completion or cancellation by long running tasks, to
//! ensure that they `request_shutdown` as a response to user cancellation. Take a look at the
//! `examples/readline_async.rs` file to get an understanding of how to use this API.
//!
//! The third change is that [`ReadlineAsyncContext::try_new()`] now accepts prompts that can
//! have ANSI escape sequences in them. Here's an example of this.
//!
//! ```
//! # use r3bl_tui::readline_async::ReadlineAsyncContext;
//! # use r3bl_tui::{fg_magenta, AnsiStyledText, ok};
//! # pub async fn sample() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let prompt = {
//!         let user = "naz";
//!         let prompt_seg_1 = fg_magenta("â•­").bg_dark_gray().to_string();
//!         let prompt_seg_2 = fg_magenta(&format!("â”¤{user}â”œ")).bg_dark_gray().to_string();
//!         let prompt_seg_3 = fg_magenta("â•®").bg_dark_gray().to_string();
//!         Some(format!("{}{}{} ", prompt_seg_1, prompt_seg_2, prompt_seg_3))
//!     };
//!     let maybe_rl_ctx = ReadlineAsyncContext::try_new(prompt).await?;
//!     let Some(mut rl_ctx) = maybe_rl_ctx else {
//!         return Err(miette::miette!("Failed to create terminal").into());
//!     };
//!     ok!()
//! # }
//! ```

//!
//! # Why another async readline crate?
//!
//! This crate & repo is forked from
//! [rustyline-async](https://github.com/zyansheep/rustyline-async). However it has mostly
//! been rewritten and re-architected. Here are some changes made to the code:
//!
//! - Rearchitect the entire crate from the ground up to operate in a totally different
//!   manner than the original. All the underlying mental models are different, and
//!   simpler. The main event loop is redone. And a task is used to monitor the line
//!   channel for communication between multiple [`crate::SharedWriter`]s and the
//!   [`Readline`], to properly support pause and resume, and other control functions.
//! - Drop support for all async runtimes other than `tokio`. Rewrite all the code for
//!   this.
//! - Drop crates like `pin-project`, `thingbuf` in favor of `tokio`. Rewrite all the code
//!   for this.
//! - Drop `simplelog` and `log` dependencies. Add support for `tokio-tracing`. Rewrite
//!   all the code for this, and add `tracing_setup.rs`.
//! - Remove all examples and create new ones to mimic a real world CLI application.
//! - Add `spinner_impl`, `readline_impl`, and `public_api` modules.
//! - Add tests.
