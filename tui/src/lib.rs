//!
//! We are working on building command line apps in Rust which have rich text user interfaces (TUI).
//! We want to lean into the terminal as a place of productivity, and build all kinds of awesome
//! apps for it.
//!
//! 1. 🔮 Instead of just building one app, we are building a library to enable any kind of rich TUI
//!    development w/ a twist: taking concepts that work really well for the frontend mobile and web
//!    development world and re-imagining them for TUI & Rust.
//!
//!    - Taking inspiration from React, JSX, CSS, Redux, Elm, iced-rs, JetPack Compose,
//!      but making things fast and Rusty and simple. For example, instead of using Redux
//!      for complex state management and handling async middleware functions, we simply
//!      using `tokio::mpsc` channels and allow tasks to send signals to the main thread to
//!      re-render or relay these signals to the appropriate app logic.
//!    - Even the thread running the main event loop doesn't block since it is async.
//!    - Using proc macros to create DSLs to implement CSS & JSX.
//!
//! 2. 🌎 We are building apps to enhance developer productivity & workflows.
//!
//!    - The idea here is not to rebuild tmux in Rust (separate processes mux'd onto a
//!      single terminal window). Rather it is to build a set of integrated "apps" (or
//!      "tasks") that run in the same process that renders to one terminal window.
//!    - Inside of this terminal window, we can implement things like "app" switching,
//!      routing, tiling layout, stacking layout, etc. so that we can manage a lot of TUI
//!      apps (which are tightly integrated) that are running in the same process, in the
//!      same window. So you can imagine that all these "app"s have shared application
//!      state (that is in a Redux store). Each "app" may also have its own Redux store.
//!    - Here are some examples of the types of "app"s we plan to build (for which this
//!      infrastructure acts as the open source engine):
//!      1. Multi user text editors w/ syntax highlighting.
//!      2. Integrations w/ github issues.
//!      3. Integrations w/ calendar, email, contacts APIs.
//!
//! All the crates in the `r3bl-open-core` repo provide lots of useful functionality to
//! help you build TUI (text user interface) apps, along w/ general niceties & ergonomics
//! that all Rustaceans 🦀 can enjoy 🎉:

//! # Text User Interface engine for Rust
//!
//! You can build fully async TUI (text user interface) apps with a modern API that brings
//! the best of the web frontend development ideas to TUI apps written in Rust:
//!
//! 1. Reactive & unidirectional data flow architecture from frontend web development
//!    (React, Redux).
//! 2. Responsive design w/ CSS, flexbox like concepts.
//! 3. Declarative style of expressing styling and layouts.
//!
//! And since this is using Rust and Tokio you get the advantages of concurrency and
//! parallelism built-in. No more blocking the main thread for user input, for async
//! middleware, or even rendering 🎉.
//!
//! > This framework is [loosely coupled and strongly
//! > coherent](https://developerlife.com/2015/11/05/loosely-coupled-strongly-coherent/)
//! > meaning that you can pick and choose whatever pieces you would like to use w/out
//! > having the cognitive load of having to grok all the things in the codebase. Its more
//! > like a collection of mostly independent modules that work well w/ each other, but
//! > know very little about each other.
//!
//! Here are some framework highlights:
//!
//! - An easy to use and approachable API that is inspired by React, JSX, CSS, and Redux.
//!   Lots of components and things are provided for you so you don't have to build them
//!   from scratch. This is a full featured component library including:
//!   - Elm like architecture w/ unidirectional data flow. The state is mutable. Async
//!     middleware functions are supported, and they communicate w/ the main thread and
//!     the [App] using an async `tokio::mpsc` channel and signals.
//!   - CSS like declarative styling engine.
//!   - CSS like flexbox like declarative layout engine which is fully responsive. You can
//!     resize your terminal window and everything will be laid out correctly.
//!   - A terminal independent underlying rendering and painting engine (can use crossterm
//!     or termion or whatever you want).
//!   - Markdown text editor w/ syntax highlighting support, metadata (tags, title,
//!     author, date), smart lists. This uses a custom Markdown parser and custom syntax
//!     highligther. Syntax highlighting for code blocks is provided by the syntect crate.
//!   - Modal dialog boxes. And autocompletion dialog boxes.
//!   - Lolcat (color gradients) implementation w/ a rainbow color-wheel palette. All the
//!     color output is sensitive to the capabilities of the terminal. Colors are
//!     gracefully downgraded from truecolor, to ANSI256, to grayscale.
//!   - Support for Unicode grapheme clusters in strings. You can safely use emojis, and
//!     other Unicode characters in your TUI apps.
//!   - Support for mouse events.
//! - The entire TUI framework itself supports concurrency & parallelism (user input,
//!   rendering, etc. are generally non blocking).
//! - It is fast! There are no needless re-renders, or flickering. Animations and color
//!   changes are smooth (check this out for yourself by running the examples). You can
//!   even build your TUI in layers (like z-order in a browser's DOM).
//!

//!
//! Once you've cloned [the repo](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core) to a folder
//! on your computer, you can run the examples you see in the video with the following
//! commands:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cd tui/examples
//! cargo run --release --example demo
//! ```
//!
//! > Linux users might need to install [libxcb](https://xcb.freedesktop.org/) in order to use

//!
//! These examples cover the entire surface area of the TUI API. You can also take a look
//! at the tests in the source (`tui/src/`) as well. A single [`nu`
//! shell](https://www.nushell.sh/) script `run.nu` in **the `tui` sub folder** in the repo
//! allows you to easily build, run, test, and do so much more with the repo.
//!
//! > The `run.nu` script works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. On Linux and macOS, you can
//! > simply run `./run.nu` instead of `nu run.nu`.
//!
//! - `nu run.nu help`: This will show you all the commands that you can pass to the `run.nu`
//!   script.
//! - `nu run.nu run-release`: This will simply run the examples w/ the release build (so it
//!    will be fast). You can watch the logs by running `nu run.nu log`.
//! - `nu run.nu run`: This will simply run the examples. You can watch the logs by running
//!   `nu run.nu log`.
//! - `nu run.nu test`: Run all the tests (in all crates in the Rust workspace).
//! - `nu run.nu watch-one-test`: Run a single test and watch it in the given crate / folder.
//! - `nu run.nu build`: build the code in all the crates in the Rust workspace.
//! - `nu run.nu log`: Run the logger to see log output. This
//!   [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy26IMkOEiM) has a walkthrough of how to use
//!   this.
//! - `nu run.nu run-with-flamegraph-profiling`: This will run the examples and generate a
//!   flamegraph at the end so you can see profile the performance of the app. This
//!   [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy26IMkOEiM) has a walkthrough of how to use
//!   this.
//! - `nu run.nu docs`: Generate docs for all the crates in the Rust workspace.
//! - `nu run.nu clippy`: Run clippy on all the crates in the Rust workspace.
//! - `nu run.nu rustfmt`: Run rustfmt on all the crates in the Rust workspace.
//! - `nu run.nu run-with-crash-reporting`: This will run the examples and generate a
//!    `crash_log.txt` file (in the `tui` folder) in case the app crashes. This is useful for
//!    debugging.
//! - and more!
//!
//! There's also a `run.nu` script at the **top level folder** of the repo. It is intended to
//! be used in a CI/CD environment w/ all the required arguments supplied or in
//! interactive mode, where the user will be prompted for input.
//! - `nu run.nu all`: There's a command called `all` that you can use to run all the
//!   tests, linting, formatting, etc. in one go by running `./run.nu all` at the top
//!   level folder of the repo.
//! - `nu run.nu build-full`: This will build all the crates in the Rust workspace. And it
//!   will install all the required pre-requisite tools needed to work with this crate
//!   (what `install-cargo-tools` does) and clear the cargo cache, cleaning, and then do a
//!   really clean build.
//! - `nu run.nu install-cargo-tools`: This will install all the required pre-requisite
//!   tools needed to work with this crate (things like `cargo-deny`, `flamegraph` will
//!   all be installed in one go).
//! - `nu run.nu check-licenses`: Use `cargo-deny` to audit all licenses used in the Rust
//!   workspace.

//!
//! - The main struct for building a TUI app is your struct which implements the [App] trait.
//! - The main event loop takes an [App] trait object and starts listening for input events. It
//!   enters raw mode, and paints to an alternate screen buffer, leaving your original scroll back
//!   buffer and history intact. When you exit this TUI app, it will return your terminal to where
//!   you'd left off.
//! - The [main_event_loop] is where many global structs live which are shared across the lifetime
//!   of your app. These include the following:
//!   - [HasFocus]
//!   - [ComponentRegistryMap]
//!   - [GlobalData] which contains the following
//!     - Global application state. This is mutable. Whenever an input event or signal is
//!       processed the entire [App] gets re-rendered. This is the unidirectional data
//!       flow architecture inspired by React and Redux, and Elm.
//! - Your [App] trait impl is the main entry point for laying out the entire application.
//!   Before the first render, the [App] is initialized (via a call to [App::app_init]), and
//!   is responsible for creating all the [Component]s that it uses, and saving them to
//!   the [ComponentRegistryMap].
//!   - State is stored in many places. Globally at the [GlobalData] level, and also in
//!     [App], and also in [Component].
//! - This sets everything up so that [App::app_render], [App::app_handle_input_event],
//!   and [App::app_handle_signal] can be called at a later time.
//! - The [App::app_render] method is responsible for creating the layout by using
//!   [Surface] and [FlexBox] to arrange whatever [Component]'s are in the
//!   [ComponentRegistryMap].
//! - The [App::app_handle_input_event] method is responsible for handling events that
//!   are sent to the [App] trait when user input is detected from the keyboard or mouse.
//!   Similarly the [App::app_handle_signal] deals with signals that are sent from
//!   background threads (Tokio tasks) to the main thread, which then get routed to the
//!   [App] trait object. Typically this will then get routed to the [Component] that
//!   currently has focus.
//!
//! ## Switching from shared memory to message passing architecture after v0.3.10
//!
//! Versions of this crate <= `0.3.10` used shared memory to communicate between the
//! background threads and the main thread. This was done using the async `Arc<RwLock<T>>`
//! from tokio. The state storage, mutation, subscription (on change handlers) were all
//! managed by the [`r3bl_redux`](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/tree/main/redux)
//! crate. The use of the Redux pattern, inspired by React, brought with it a lot of overhead
//! both mentally and in terms of performance (since state changes needed to be cloned every
//! time a change was made, and `memcpy` or `clone` is expensive).
//!
//! Versions > `0.3.10` use message passing to communicate between the background threads
//! using the `tokio::mpsc` channel (also async). This is a much easier and more performant
//! model given the nature of the engine and the use cases it has to handle. It also has the
//! benefit of providing an easy way to attach protocol servers in the future over various
//! transport layers (eg: TCP, IPC, etc.); these protocol servers can be used to manage a
//! connection between a process running the engine, and other processes running on the same
//! host or on other hosts, in order to handle use cases like synchronizing rendered output,
//! or state.
//!
//! > Here are some papers outlining the differences between message passing and shared memory
//! > for communication between threads.
//! >
//! > 1. <https://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/intro-hpchtc/morea/lesson2/reading4.html>

//!
//! # Life of an input event
//!
//! There is a clear separation of concerns in this module. To illustrate what goes where, and how
//! things work let's look at an example that puts the main event loop front and center & deals w/
//! how the system handles an input event (key press or mouse).
//!
//! - The diagram below shows an app that has 3 [Component]s for (flexbox like) layout & (CSS like)
//!   styling.
//! - Let's say that you run this app (by hypothetically executing `cargo run`).
//! - And then you click or type something in the terminal window that you're running this app in.

//!
//! Let's trace the journey through the diagram when an input even is generated by the user (eg: a
//! key press, or mouse event). When the app is started via `cargo run` it sets up a main loop, and
//! lays out all the 3 components, sizes, positions, and then paints them. Then it asynchronously
//! listens for input events (no threads are blocked). When the user types something, this input is
//! processed by the main loop of [TerminalWindow].
//!
//! 1. The [Component] that is in [FlexBox] w/ `id=1` currently has focus.
//! 2. When an input event comes in from the user (key press or mouse input) it is routed to the
//!    [App] first, before [TerminalWindow] looks at the event.
//! 3. The specificity of the event handler in [App] is higher than the default input handler in
//!    [TerminalWindow]. Further, the specificity of the [Component] that currently has focus is the
//!    highest. In other words, the input event gets routed by the [App] to the [Component] that
//!    currently has focus ([Component] id=1 in our example).
//! 4. Since it is not guaranteed that some [Component] will have focus, this input event can then
//!    be handled by [App], and if not, then by [TerminalWindow]'s default handler. If the default
//!    handler doesn't process it, then it is simply ignored.
//! 5. In this journey, as the input event is moved between all these different entities, each
//!    entity decides whether it wants to handle the input event or not. If it does, then it returns
//!    an enum indicating that the event has been consumed, else, it returns an enum that indicates
//!    the event should be propagated.
//!
//! An input event is processed by the main thread in the main event loop. This is a
//! synchronous operation and thus it is safe to mutate state directly in this code path. This
//! is why there is no sophisticated locking in place. You can mutate the state directly in
//! - [App::app_handle_input_event]
//! - [Component::handle_event]
//!
//! ## Life of a signal (aka "out of band event")
//! <a id="markdown-life-of-a-signal-aka-%22out-of-band-event%22" name="life-of-a-signal-aka-%22out-of-band-event%22"></a>
//!
//! This is great for input events which are generated by the user using their keyboard or
//! mouse. These are all considered "in-band" events or signals, which have no delay or
//! asynchronous behavior. But what about "out of band" signals or events, which do have
//! unknown delays and asynchronous behaviors? These are important to handle as well. For
//! example, if you want to make an HTTP request, you don't want to block the main thread.
//! In these cases you can use a `tokio::mpsc` channel to send a signal from a background
//! thread to the main thread. This is how you can handle "out of band" events or signals.
//!
//! To provide support for these "out of band" events or signals, the [App] trait has a method
//! called [App::app_handle_signal]. This is where you can handle signals that are sent from
//! background threads. One of the arguments to this associated function is a `signal`. This
//! signal needs to contain all the data that is needed for a state mutation to occur on the
//! main thread. So the background thread has the responsibility of doing some work (eg:
//! making an HTTP request), getting some information as a result, and then packaging that
//! information into a `signal` and sending it to the main thread. The main thread then
//! handles this signal by calling the [App::app_handle_signal] method. This method can then
//! mutate the state of the [App] and return an [EventPropagation] enum indicating whether the
//! main thread should repaint the UI or not.
//!
//! So far we have covered what happens when the [App] receives a signal. Who sends this
//! signal? Who actually creates the `tokio::spawn` task that sends this signal? This can
//! happen anywhere in the [App] and [Component]. Any code that has access to [GlobalData]
//! can use the [r3bl_rs_utils_core::send_signal!] macro to send a signal in a background
//! task. However, only the [App] can receive the signal and do something with it, which
//! is usually apply the signal to update the state and then tell the main thread to
//! repaint the UI.
//!
//! Now that we have seen this whirlwind overview of the life of an input event, let's look at
//! the details in each of the sections below.
//!
//!
//! # The window
//! <a id="markdown-the-window" name="the-window"></a>
//!
//! The main building blocks of a TUI app are:
//! 1. [TerminalWindow] - You can think of this as the main "window" of the app. All the content of
//!    your app is painted inside of this "window". And the "window" conceptually maps to the screen
//!    that is contained inside your terminal emulator program (eg: tilix, Terminal.app, etc). Your
//!    TUI app will end up taking up 100% of the screen space of this terminal emulator. It will
//!    also enter raw mode, and paint to an alternate screen buffer, leaving your original scroll
//!    back buffer and history intact. When you exit this TUI app, it will return your terminal to
//!    where you'd left off. You don't write this code, this is something that you use.
//! 2. [App] - This is where you write your code. You pass in a [App] to the [TerminalWindow] to
//!    bootstrap your TUI app. You can just use [App] to build your app, if it is a simple one & you
//!    don't really need any sophisticated layout or styling. But if you want layout and styling,
//!    now we have to deal with [FlexBox], [Component], and [r3bl_rs_utils_core::Style].
//!
//! # Layout and styling
//! <a id="markdown-layout-and-styling" name="layout-and-styling"></a>
//!
//! Inside of your [App] if you want to use flexbox like layout and CSS like styling you can think of
//! composing your code in the following way:
//!
//! 1.  [App] is like a box or container. You can attach styles and an id here. The id has to be unique,
//!     and you can reference as many styles as you want from your stylesheet. Yes, cascading styles are
//!     supported! 👏 You can put boxes inside of boxes. You can make a container box and inside of that
//!     you can add other boxes (you can give them a direction and even relative sizing out of 100%).
//! 2.  As you approach the "leaf" nodes of your layout, you will find [Component] trait objects. These
//!     are black boxes which are sized, positioned, and painted _relative_ to their parent box. They
//!     get to handle input events and render [RenderOp]s into a [RenderPipeline]. This is kind of like
//!     virtual DOM in React. This queue of commands is collected from all the components and ultimately
//!     painted to the screen, for each render! Your app's state is mutable and is stored in the
//!     [GlobalData] struct. You can handle out of band events as well using the signal mechanism.
//!
//! ## Component, ComponentRegistry, focus management, and event routing
//! <a id="markdown-component%2C-componentregistry%2C-focus-management%2C-and-event-routing" name="component%2C-componentregistry%2C-focus-management%2C-and-event-routing"></a>
//!
//!
//! Typically your [App] will look like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! pub struct AppMain {
//!   // Might have some app data here as well.
//!   // Or `_phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<(State, AppSignal)>,`
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! As we look at [Component] & [App] more closely we will find a curious thing [ComponentRegistry]
//! (that is managed by the [App]). The reason this exists is for input event routing. The input events
//! are routed to the [Component] that currently has focus.
//!
//! The [HasFocus] struct takes care of this. This provides 2 things:
//!
//! 1.  It holds an `id` of a [FlexBox] / [Component] that has focus.
//! 2.  It also holds a map that holds a [r3bl_rs_utils_core::Position] for each `id`. This is used to represent a
//!     cursor (whatever that means to your app & component). This cursor is maintained for each `id`.
//!     This allows a separate cursor for each [Component] that has focus. This is needed to build apps
//!     like editors and viewers that maintains a cursor position between focus switches.
//!
//! Another thing to keep in mind is that the [App] and [TerminalWindow] is persistent between
//! re-renders. The Redux store is also persistent between re-renders.
//!
//! ## Input event specificity
//! <a id="markdown-input-event-specificity" name="input-event-specificity"></a>
//!
//! [TerminalWindow] gives [Component] first dibs when it comes to handling input events. If it
//! punts handling this event, it will be handled by the default input event handler. And if nothing
//! there matches this event, then it is simply dropped.
//!
//! ## Rendering and painting
//! <a id="markdown-rendering-and-painting" name="rendering-and-painting"></a>
//!
//! The R3BL TUI engine uses a high performance compositor to render the UI to the terminal. This
//! ensures that only "pixels" that have changed are painted to the terminal. This is done by
//! creating a concept of `PixelChar` which represents a single "pixel" in the terminal screen at a
//! given col and row index position. There are only as many `PixelChar`s as there are rows and cols
//! in a terminal screen. And the index maps directly to the position of the pixel in the terminal
//! screen.
//!
//! ### Offscreen buffer
//! <a id="markdown-offscreen-buffer" name="offscreen-buffer"></a>
//!
//! Here is an example of what a single row of rendered output might look like in a row of the
//! `OffscreenBuffer`. This diagram shows each `PixelChar` in `row_index: 1` of the
//! `OffscreenBuffer`. In this example, there are 80 columns in the terminal screen. This actual log
//! output generated by the TUI engine when logging is enabled.
//!
//! ```text

//! ```
//!
//! When `RenderOps` are executed and used to create an `OffscreenBuffer` that maps to the size of
//! the terminal window, clipping is performed automatically. This means that it isn't possible to
//! move the caret outside of the bounds of the viewport (terminal window size). And it isn't
//! possible to paint text that is larger than the size of the offscreen buffer. The buffer really
//! represents the current state of the viewport. Scrolling has to be handled by the component
//! itself (an example of this is the editor component).
//!
//! Each `PixelChar` can be one of 4 things:
//!
//! 1. **Space**. This is just an empty space. There is no flickering in the TUI engine. When a new
//!    offscreen buffer is created, it is fulled w/ spaces. Then components paint over the spaces.
//!    Then the diffing algorithm only paints over the pixels that have changed. You don't have to
//!    worry about clearing the screen and painting, which typically will cause flickering in
//!    terminals. You also don't have to worry about printing empty spaces over areas that you would
//!    like to clear between renders. All of this handled by the TUI engine.
//! 2. **Void**. This is a special pixel that is used to indicate that the pixel should be ignored.
//!    It is used to indicate a wide emoji is to the left somewhere. Most terminals don't support
//!    emojis, so there's a discrepancy between the display width of the character and its index in
//!    the string.
//! 3. **Plain text**. This is a normal pixel which wraps a single character that maybe a grapheme
//!    cluster segment. Styling information is encoded in each `PixelChar::PlainText` and is used to
//!    paint the screen via the diffing algorithm which is smart enough to "stack" styles that
//!    appear beside each other for quicker rendering in terminals.
//! 4. **ANSI text**. Styling information in not available w/ these characters because the styling
//!    information is encoded in the ANSI escape codes. `lolcat_api.rs` generates these ANSI strings
//!    for the rainbow effect. An example of this is the outline around a modal dialog box.
//!
//! ### Render pipeline
//! <a id="markdown-render-pipeline" name="render-pipeline"></a>

//! The following diagram provides a high level overview of how apps (that contain components,
//! which may contain components, and so on) are rendered to the terminal screen.

//!
//! Each component produces a `RenderPipeline`, which is a map of `ZOrder` and `Vec<RenderOps>`.
//! `RenderOps` are the instructions that are grouped together, such as move the caret to a
//! position, set a color, and paint some text.
//!
//! Inside of each `RenderOps` the caret is stateful, meaning that the caret position is remembered
//! after each `RenderOp` is executed. However, once a new `RenderOps` is executed, the caret
//! position reset just for that `RenderOps`. Caret position is not stored globally. You should read
//! more about "atomic paint operations" in the `RenderOp` documentation.
//!
//! Once a set of these `RenderPipeline`s have been generated, typically after the user enters some
//! input event, and that produces a new state which then has to be rendered, they are combined and
//! painted into an `OffscreenBuffer`.
//!
//! ## First render
//! <a id="markdown-first-render" name="first-render"></a>
//!
//! The `paint.rs` file contains the `paint` function, which is the entry point for all rendering.
//! Once the first render occurs, the `OffscreenBuffer` that is generated is saved to
//! `GlobalSharedState`. The following table shows the various tasks that have to be performed in
//! order to render to an `OffscreenBuffer`. There is a different code path that is taken for ANSI
//! text and plain text (which includes `StyledText` which is just plain text with a color). Syntax
//! highlighted text is also just `StyledText`. The ANSI text is an example of text that is
//! generated by the `lolcat_api.rs`.
//!
//! | UTF-8 | ANSI | Task                                                                                                    |
//! | ----- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
//! | Y     | Y    | convert `RenderPipeline` to `List<List<PixelChar>>` (`OffscreenBuffer`)                                 |
//! | Y     | Y    | paint each `PixelChar` in `List<List<PixelChar>>` to stdout using `OffscreenBufferPainterImplCrossterm` |
//! | Y     | Y    | save the `List<List<PixelChar>>` to `GlobalSharedState`                                                 |
//!
//! Currently only `crossterm` is supported for actually painting to the terminal. But this process
//! is really simple making it very easy to swap out other terminal libraries such as `termion`, or
//! even a GUI backend, or some other custom output driver.
//!
//! ## Subsequent render
//! <a id="markdown-subsequent-render" name="subsequent-render"></a>
//!
//! Since the `OffscreenBuffer` is cached in `GlobalSharedState` a diff to be performed for
//! subsequent renders. And only those diff chunks are painted to the screen. This ensures that
//! there is no flicker when the content of the screen changes. It also minimizes the amount of work
//! that the terminal or terminal emulator has to do put the `PixelChar`s on the screen.
//!
//! ## How does the editor component work?
//! <a id="markdown-how-does-the-editor-component-work%3F" name="how-does-the-editor-component-work%3F"></a>
//!
//!
//! The `EditorComponent` struct can hold data in its own memory, in addition to relying on the state.
//!
//! - It has an `EditorEngine` which holds syntax highlighting information, and configuration options
//!   for the editor (such as multiline mode enabled or not, syntax highlighting enabled or not, etc.).
//!   Note that this information lives outside of the state.
//! - It also implements the `Component<S,A>` trait.
//! - However, for the reusable editor component we need the data representing the document being edited
//!   to be stored in the state (`EditorBuffer`) and not inside of the `EditorComponent` itself.
//!   - This is why the state must implement the trait `HasEditorBuffers` which is where the document
//!     data is stored (the key is the id of the flex box in which the editor component is placed).
//!   - The `EditorBuffer` contains the text content in a `Vec` of `UnicodeString`. Where each line is
//!     represented by a `UnicodeString`. It also contains the scroll offset, caret position, and file
//!     extension for syntax highlighting.
//!
//! In other words,
//!
//! 1.  `EditorEngine` -> **This goes in `EditorComponent`**
//!     - Contains the logic to process keypresses and modify an editor buffer.
//! 2.  `EditorBuffer` -> **This goes in the `State`**
//!     - Contains the data that represents the document being edited. This contains the caret
//!       (insertion point) position and scroll position. And in the future can contain lots of other
//!       information such as undo / redo history, etc.
//!
//! Here are the connection points w/ the impl of `Component<S,A>` in `EditorComponent`:
//!
//! 1.  `handle_event(input_event: &InputEvent, state: &S, shared_store: &SharedStore<S, A>)`
//!     - Can simply relay the arguments to `EditorEngine::apply(state.editor_buffer, input_event)`
//!       which will return another `EditorBuffer`.
//!     - Return value can be dispatched to the store via an action `UpdateEditorBuffer(EditorBuffer)`.
//! 2.  `render(has_focus: &HasFocus, current_box: &FlexBox, state: &S, shared_store: &SharedStore<S,A>)`
//!     - Can simply relay the arguments to `EditorEngine::render(state.editor_buffer)`
//!     - Which will return a `RenderPipeline`.
//!
//! ### Painting the caret
//! <a id="markdown-painting-the-caret" name="painting-the-caret"></a>
//!
//!
//! > Definitions
//! >
//! > **`Caret`** - the block that is visually displayed in a terminal which represents the insertion
//! > point for whatever is in focus. While only one insertion point is editable for the local user,
//! > there may be multiple of them, in which case there has to be a way to distinguish a local caret

//! >
//! > **`Cursor`** - the global "thing" provided in terminals that shows by blinking usually where the
//! > cursor is. This cursor is moved around and then paint operations are performed on various
//! > different areas in a terminal window to paint the output of render operations.
//!
//! There are two ways of showing cursors which are quite different (each w/ very different
//! constraints).
//!
//! 1. Using a global terminal cursor (we don't use this).
//!
//!    - Both [termion::cursor](https://docs.rs/termion/1.5.6/termion/cursor/index.html) and
//!      [crossterm::cursor](https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.25.0/crossterm/cursor/index.html) support this.
//!      The cursor has lots of effects like blink, etc.
//!    - The downside is that there is one global cursor for any given terminal window. And this cursor
//!      is constantly moved around in order to paint anything (eg:
//!      `MoveTo(col, row), SetColor, PaintText(...)` sequence).
//!
//! 2. Paint the character at the cursor w/ the colors inverted (or some other bg color) giving the
//!    visual effect of a cursor.
//!    - This has the benefit that we can display multiple cursors in the app, since this is not global,
//!      rather it is component specific. For the use case requiring google docs style multi user
//!      editing where multiple cursors need to be shown, this approach can be used in order to
//!      implement that. Each user for eg can get a different caret background color to differentiate
//!      their caret from others.
//!    - The downside is that it isn't possible to blink the cursor or have all the other "standard"
//!      cursor features that are provided by the actual global cursor (discussed above).
//!
//! ## How do modal dialog boxes work?
//! <a id="markdown-how-do-modal-dialog-boxes-work%3F" name="how-do-modal-dialog-boxes-work%3F"></a>
//!
//!
//! A modal dialog box is different than a normal reusable component. This is because:
//!
//! 1. It paints on top of the entire screen (in front of all other components, in ZOrder::Glass, and
//!    outside of any layouts using `FlexBox`es).
//! 2. Is "activated" by a keyboard shortcut (hidden otherwise). Once activated, the user can accept or
//!    cancel the dialog box. And this results in a callback being called w/ the result.
//!
//! So this activation trigger must be done at the `App` trait impl level (in the `app_handle_event()`
//! method). Also, when this trigger is detected it has to:
//!
//! 1. Set the focus to the dialog box, so that it will appear on the next render. When trigger is
//!    detected it will return a `EventPropagation::Consumed` which won't force a render.
//! 2. Set the title and text via a dispatch of the action `SetDialogBoxTitleAndText`. This will force a
//!    render, and the title and text in the dialog box on next render.
//!
//! There is a question about where does the response from the user (once a dialog is shown) go? This
//! seems as though it would be different in nature from an `EditorComponent` but it is the same. Here's
//! why:
//!
//! - The `EditorComponent` is always updating its buffer based on user input, and there's no "handler"
//!   for when the user performs some action on the editor. The editor needs to save all the changes to
//!   the buffer to the state. This requires the trait bound `HasEditorBuffers` to be implemented by the
//!   state.
//! - The dialog box seems different in that you would think that it doesn't always updating its state
//!   and that the only time we really care about what state the dialog box has is when the user has
//!   accepted something they've typed into the dialog box and this needs to be sent to the callback
//!   function that was passed in when the component was created. However, due to the reactive nature of
//!   the TUI engine, even before the callback is called (due to the user accepting or cancelling),
//!   while the user is typing things into the dialog box, it has to be updating the state, otherwise,
//!   re-rendering the dialog box won't be triggered and the user won't see what they're typing. This
//!   means that even intermediate information needs to be recorded into the state via the
//!   `HasDialogBuffers` trait bound. This will hold stale data once the dialog is dismissed or
//!   accepted, but that's ok since the title and text should always be set before it is shown.
//!   - **Note**: it might be possible to save this type of intermediate data in
//!     `ComponentRegistry::user_data`. And it is possible for `handle_event()` to return a
//!     `EventPropagation::ConsumedRerender` to make sure that changes are re-rendered. This approach
//!     may have other issues related to having both immutable and mutable borrows at the same time to
//!     some portion of the component registry if one is not careful.
//!
//! ### Two callback functions
//! <a id="markdown-two-callback-functions" name="two-callback-functions"></a>
//!
//!
//! When creating a new dialog box component, two callback functions are passed in:
//!
//! 1. `on_dialog_press_handler()` - this will be called if the user choose no, or yes (w/ their typed
//!    text).
//! 2. `on_dialog_editors_changed_handler()` - this will be called if the user types something into the
//!    editor.
//!
//! ### How to use this dialog to make an HTTP request & pipe the results into a selection area?
//! <a id="markdown-how-to-use-this-dialog-to-make-an-http-request-%26-pipe-the-results-into-a-selection-area%3F" name="how-to-use-this-dialog-to-make-an-http-request-%26-pipe-the-results-into-a-selection-area%3F"></a>
//!
//!
//! So far we have covered the use case for a simple modal dialog box. In order to provide
//! auto-completion capabilities, via some kind of web service, there needs to be a slightly more
//! complex version of this. This is where the `DialogEngineConfigOptions` struct comes in. It allows us
//! to create a dialog component and engine to be configured w/ the appropriate mode - simple or
//! autocomplete.
//!
//! In autocomplete mode, an extra "results panel" is displayed, and the layout of the dialog is
//! different on the screen. Instead of being in the middle of the screen, it starts at the top of the
//! screen. The callbacks are the same.
//!
//! ### How to make HTTP requests
//! <a id="markdown-how-to-make-http-requests" name="how-to-make-http-requests"></a>
//!
//!
//! Instead of using the `reqwest` crate, we should use the `hyper` crate (which is part of Tokio) and
//! drop support for `reqwest` in all our crates.
//!

//!
//! ## Custom Markdown (MD) parsing and custom syntax highlighting
//!
//! The code for parsing and syntax highlighting is in [try_parse_and_highlight].
//!
//! A custom Markdown parser is provided to provide some extensions over the standard
//! Markdown syntax. The parser code is in the [parse_markdown] function. Here are some of
//! the extensions:
//! - Metadata title (eg: `@title: <title_text>`). Similar to front matter.
//! - Metadata tags (eg: `@tags: <tag1>, <tag2>`).
//! - Metadata authors (eg: `@authors: <author1>, <author2>`).
//! - Metadata date (eg: `@date: <date>`).
//!
//! Some other changes are adding support for smart lists. These are lists that span
//! multiple lines of text. And indentation levels are tracked. This information is used
//! to render the list items in a way that is visually appealing.
//! - The code for parsing smart lists is in [parse_smart_list].
//! - The code for syntax highlighting is in
//!   [StyleUSSpanLines::from_document].
//!
//! Also, `syntect` crate is still used by the editor component
//! [EditorEngineApi::render_engine] to syntax highlight the text inside code blocks of
//! Markdown documents.
//!
//! An alternative approach to doing this was considered using the crate `markdown-rs`, but we
//! decided to implement our own parser using
//! [`nom`](https://developerlife.com/2023/02/20/guide-to-nom-parsing/) since it was streaming
//! and used less CPU and memory.
//!
//! # Grapheme support
//! <a id="markdown-grapheme-support" name="grapheme-support"></a>
//!
//! Unicode is supported (to an extent). There are some caveats. The
//! [r3bl_rs_utils_core::UnicodeString] struct has lots of great information on this graphemes and
//! what is supported and what is not.
//!
//! # Lolcat support
//! <a id="markdown-lolcat-support" name="lolcat-support"></a>
//!
//! An implementation of lolcat color wheel is provided. Here's an example.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use r3bl_rs_utils_core::*;
//! use r3bl_tui::*;
//!
//! let mut lolcat = LolcatBuilder::new()
//!   .set_color_change_speed(ColorChangeSpeed::Rapid)
//!   .set_seed(1.0)
//!   .set_seed_delta(1.0)
//!   .build();
//!
//! let content = "Hello, world!";
//! let unicode_string = UnicodeString::from(content);
//! let lolcat_mut = &mut lolcat;
//! let st = lolcat_mut.colorize_to_styled_texts(&unicode_string);
//!
//! lolcat.next_color();
//! ```
//!
//! This [crate::lolcat::Lolcat] that is returned by `build()` is safe to re-use.
//! - The colors it cycles through are "stable" meaning that once constructed via the
//!   [builder](crate::lolcat::LolcatBuilder) (which sets the speed, seed, and delta
//!   that determine where the color wheel starts when it is used). For eg, when used in a dialog
//!   box component that re-uses the instance, repeated calls to the `render()` function of this
//!   component will produce the same generated colors over and over again.
//! - If you want to change where the color wheel "begins", you have to change the speed, seed, and
//!   delta of this [crate::lolcat::Lolcat] instance.
